""The daily time that I don’t spend on (payroll) … it really changes my daily routine. It allows me to make phone calls, answer emails, talk with general contractors and talk with my franchise (personnel). Having the ability to do that streamlines both processes.""
“Being able to promote the jobs that we have with the different platforms that Paychex has, to get our jobs out there and recruit more people, they’ve made the onboarding process a lot easier for us to hire as quickly as possible.”
“In working with Paychex, it has given me the freedom to work on the business knowing that our payroll is being taken care of and being managed day to day, and I don’t have to worry about it, which is beautiful.”
“We had a different kind of workers' compensation program and I found out very early on that when you don't have an eye on it right throughout the year, it can add up. [Now] we know exactly what we're paying at the end of the year and it's honestly helped us so much for our budgeting.”
""In order for my business to do well, I basically have to pay lots of attention to the quality, the training, the employees. So, considering all of this, I am very happy I am with Paychex because they are making it easy for me.""
“Paychex is an honest company. They provide a top quality platform and their employees are always cheerful, kind and willing to help. They treat me they way I treat my clients.”
