A brief history
Armed with a credit card and a dream, two college friends, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar set out to create Atlassian. In 2002, they didn't know what kind of company Atlassian was going to be, but they knew exactly what it shouldn't be—an environment where they had to conform rather than be who they authentically are.

Protect Life
Officers aren’t trained to shoot to kill. They are trained to stop a threat. They use the tools they are given, and often have less than a second to make life-or-death decisions. Let’s give them better tools and put the toughest decisions in the hands of the courts. One day the bullet will be obsolete. We’re working on a device that will out-perform the handgun in every situation and let the people on either side of the weapon go home safe at the end of the day.
Preserve Truth
We have the potential for more objective sources of truth than ever before. Footage from body camera, CCTV, drones, smartphones and vehicles. All centralized, redacted and shared with an iron-clad chain of custody. With video at the heart of the record, we’ll help enable better insights, transparency with our communities, and decision making.
Accelerate Justice
Officers spend up to 2/3rds of their shift doing paperwork. The technology exists today to remove this administrative burden. To streamline and automate the tedious, error-prone parts of an officer’s job. We’re building it into our agency tech stack, featuring Axon Records and Axon Evidence. These innovations will accelerate the path to justice, let officers go back to serving their communities and keep them nearby when we need them most.
Our Impact
Our
Impact
Let’s look at the numbers. We’re taking on some of society’s most difficult challenges. It’s controversial. But we’re driven by one clear goal: Protect life. The number that matters most is the estimate of lives saved. This represents the number of times lethal force was justified but not used because an officer used a TASER device to de-escalate the situation. We still have a lot to do, but we’re proud that officers have that choice.

Our mission
We help people achieve independence by making it easier to start, run, and grow a business. We believe the future of commerce has more voices, not fewer, so we’re reducing the barriers to business ownership to make commerce better for everyone.
Our team and our social impact
Shopify has grown from 5 people in a coffee shop to over 10,000 across the globe. With millions of businesses powered by Shopify, we invest in our people and our communities. Our Social Impact initiatives focus on enabling an equitable future by building products and programs to support our team and merchants.
Our commitment to sustainability
Shopify builds for the long term, and that means investing in our planet so that we can future proof Shopify and help our merchants future proof their businesses, too.
