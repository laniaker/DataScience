        "Raw_Text": "Overview\nThe Next Evolution in Principled Simulation and AI-Powered Innovations\nBy combining NVIDIA-based GPU technology with a comprehensive suite of Cadence’s computational software and AI, the Cadence Millennium M2000 Supercomputer enables a shift-left of in-design analysis through high-fidelity simulation and massive acceleration of the design, analysis, and optimization process. Spanning applications from chip design and data centers to automotive, aircraft engineering, and drug discovery, this next-generation platform will be critical to transforming AI-driven silicon, systems, and drug design.\nKey Benefits\nAccelerating Silicon, Systems, and Drug Design\nGPU Acceleration\nCadence’s best-in-class solvers integrate with NVIDIA Blackwell accelerated compute to deliver unmatched scale and speed\nGreater Productivity\nGPU acceleration delivers same-day decision-making with up to 80X faster turnaround time (TAT) and up to 20X lower power\nOptimized Performance\nScalable, high-performance computing (HPC) architecture and modern GPU resident solvers are tuned for optimal system performance\nMultiphysics Analysis\nComprehensive multiphysics analysis for digital twin accuracy of entire systems\nTurnkey Solution\nComprehensive, ready-to-go supercomputing solution available on-premises or on cloud\nHighly Scalable\nStackable compute nodes scale with the application for the fastest turnaround time\nApplications\nOptimized for a Broad Range of Workloads\nThe Millennium M2000 Supercomputer harnesses Cadence’s broad array of EDA, system design analysis, and molecular solvers to perform massive simulations that were previously impossible, transforming approaches to semiconductor and 3D-IC design, data center digital twins, drug discovery modeling, and other engineering challenges across the hyperscale computing, automotive, data center, and aerospace and defense markets.\nSystem Design and Analysis\nThe Millennium M2000 Supercomputer enhances system design analysis (SDA) with capabilities that extend 3D-IC system packaging, aerospace and defense applications, and autonomous vehicle engineering.\nAs electronic and mechatronic systems grow in complexity, traditional multiphysics analysis can lead to prolonged simulation times extending days or weeks, delaying critical decision-making. The Millennium platform enables faster turnaround times and supports in-design analysis, resulting in more informed decisions and optimized designs.\nElectronic Design Automation\nFor electronic design automation (EDA), the Millennium M2000 Supercomputer’s powerful GPU acceleration integrates seamlessly with Cadence’s Voltus IC Power Integrity Solution and Spectre X Simulator.\nThe Voltus solution utilizes the Millenium GPU hardware and GPU-optimized solver to achieve over 20X improvement in runtime. The solver is scalable with lower memory requirements and enhanced fault tolerance, resulting in significantly shorter simulation times and enabling previously impossible simulations.\nDrug Discovery Automation\nCadence Molecular Sciences accelerates drug discovery by enabling pharmaceutical customers to perform more simulations in less time with Millennium CPU and GPU resources. Cadence’s Orion® Molecular Design Platform uses the Millennium M2000 Supercomputer on Cadence Cloud to equip researchers with unmatched computational power to speed up the discovery of potential drug candidates and enhance process scalability. As a result, customers can explore more design scenarios and iterations within tighter deadlines, leading to faster innovation and improved product development."
