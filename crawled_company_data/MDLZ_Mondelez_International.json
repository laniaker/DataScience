From an on-the-go “second breakfast” to a mindful moment of indulgence in the evening, consumers decide what and how they want to eat.\nPeople have less free time as they work longer hours with longer commutes. They want snacks that support a healthy lifestyle, providing nourishment and nutrition for their active, busy lives.\nWhen snacking, there is a desire for convenient and delicious options that people can feel good about eating made with less energy, water, and waste - all with ingredients they know and trust.\nThat’s why at Mondelēz International, we’re using our unique portfolio of brands to fulfill the global need for snacking. We’re leading the future of snacking by focusing on four strategic priorities.\nGrowth\nOur consumers are the reason we want to be the best snacking company in the world and why we put them at the heart of everything we do.

        "Raw_Text": "OUR HISTORY\nExplore the heritage of Mondelēz International\nEven though Mondelēz International is a relatively young company (founded October 1, 2012), it was built on the foundation of several predecessor companies, most of which date back over 100 years. Learn more about the rich history of our brands, legacy companies and our founders that helped make Mondelēz International who we are today.\nOur Founders\nThe birth of the modern day chewing gum industry can be traced to the 1850s when Thomas Adams Sr., a New York wholesale glass merchant and inventor, became acquainted with General Antonio López de Santa Anna, president of Mexico. When Santa Anna was exiled from Mexico and came to the U.S. in the mid-1860s, he stayed with friend Adams at his Staten Island home. Santa Anna suggested to Adams that he create a formula to make carriage or bicycle tires by experimenting with chicle, a substance found in Central American sapodilla fruit trees. About one ton of chicle from Mexico was shipped to New York and Adams, assisted by his son Thomas Jr., tried unsuccessfully to use chicle as a rubber substitute for tires and other items.\nThe supply of chicle sat in a warehouse until Adams was inspired by a girl asking for chewing gum in a New York drugstore. He came up with the idea to use the chicle to make chewing gum. Until this time, chewing gum was made with spruce tree resin or paraffin wax. In about 1869, Adams and his son started making unflavored and unsweetened chicle chewing gum in the kitchen of their home, first rolling the chicle flat with a rolling pin and then cutting it into pieces with scissors. They boxed and labeled the product “Adams’ New York Chewing Gum No. 1 – Snapping and Stretching”. Thomas Jr. took boxes of their new chewing gum and left them on consignment at drug stores. Their chicle gum was a success with consumers and soon reorders poured in.\nIn 1871 Adams registered U.S. Patent #111,798 for a method of preparing “chickly” [chicle] to produce chewing gum and began commercial mass production of the confectionery product. With two of his sons, Thomas Jr. and John D., Thomas Adams, Sr. started Adams & Sons Company in 1876.\nThe firm was the world’s most prosperous chewing gum company by the end of the century. Thomas Jr. became president of the company when Thomas Sr. retired in 1898. Thomas Jr. then built a gum powerhouse in 1899 by merging with the six largest and best-known chewing gum manufacturers in the United States and Canada, and achieved great success as the maker of Chiclets.\nThomas Adams Sr. died in 1905 at the age of 87.\nJohn Cadbury was born in Birmingham, England, on 12th August 1801. He was from a Quaker family and did not have the option to go to university as this was against Quaker beliefs. Instead he became an apprentice to a tea dealer in Leeds in 1818. He opened a grocer’s shop at 93 Bull Street, Birmingham in 1824, selling amongst other things, cocoa and drinking chocolate, which he prepared himself using a mortar and pestle. Tea, coffee, cocoa and drinking chocolate were seen as healthy alternatives to alcohol, which as a Quaker he believed was bad for society.\nAfter several years, John decided to start manufacturing on a commercial scale. In 1831 he purchased a warehouse in nearby Crooked Lane. The earliest preserved price list from 1842 shows that he was selling 16 lines of drinking chocolate in cakes and powder format, and eleven lines of cocoa in powder, flakes, paste and cocoa nibs formats. He was only selling one line of eating chocolate at this time. In 1846 John took his brother Benjamin into partnership and the name of the firm was changed to Cadbury Brothers.\nIn 1847 the business moved to a new factory in Bridge Street. . The partnership with Benjamin was dissolved by mutual consent in 1856 and John retired in 1861, handing over complete control of the business to his two sons, Richard and George. The following decades saw the Cadbury business grow to become an industry leader by harnessing the opportunities of industrialisation and creatively marketing to a growing consumer class.\nJohn Cadbury spent his retirement engaged in civic and social work in Birmingham. Philanthropy had been important to him all his life; over the years he had led a campaign to ban the use of boys as chimney sweeps, campaigned against animal cruelty and formed the Animal Friends Society, a forerunner of the RSPCA. John died on May 11th 1889, aged 87.\nWilliam M. Christie came to Canada from Scotland at the age of 19 in 1848 and worked as a baker in Toronto. In September of 1849 he joined a partnership formed by James Mathers and Alexander Brown to work as an assistant baker and traveling salesman.\nWhen James Mathers retired in 1850, Alexander Brown took William Christie into the partnership. In 1853, when Alexander Brown retired, he left the business with William Christie. In 1861, when William suffered financial setbacks, Alexander Brown returned to the business, which then adopted the name Christie, Brown & Company.\nOn February 11, 1878, Alexander Brown retired for the second time and the business was purchased by William Christie. He built his business on the premise that customers deserved a quality product with the best ingredients. After attending the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876 with samples of his biscuits, he returned with silver and bronze medals. This was just the first of many such trips and \"Mr. Christie\" soon became known for his high quality biscuits.\nIn 1900, the son of William Christie, Robert J. Christie, took over the business. At the time, the company had grown from using less than 50 barrels of flour a week to using 160 barrels of flour, one and one-half tons of butter and lard, and thousands of eggs every working day. The business, under the direction of William Christie, had expanded to the point where Christie, Brown & Company employed approximately 375 people by the turn of the century and had offices in Montreal, as well as Toronto. Deliveries were made to all parts of Canada.\nAdolphus Green, a successful attorney in Chicago, Illinois, began his association with the baking industry in the late 1880s when a committee of prominent bakery owners across the Midwest came to his office and sought his assistance. The bakers realized that times were changing and that bakeries had to change with it. The result of that meeting was the formation in 1890 of the American Biscuit & Manufacturing Company, led by Adolphus Green. This new company combined approximately 40 Midwestern bakeries in the hopes of improving product quality and efficiency.\nIn 1898, Adolphus merged his company with William Moore’s New York Biscuit Company, along with the United States Baking Company, to form the National Biscuit Company, a formidable collection of 114 bakeries. Adolphus Green was president of this new national company.\nAdolphus was convinced his new company needed a big idea to gain the public's attention. He got it very quickly when the company that same year developed a cracker with a new shape that was lighter and flakier than anything else being made at that time. He considered many names for the product and decided on Uneeda biscuit. However, the quality and freshness of the new Uneeda biscuit wouldn't mean much if the product didn't arrive for customers that way. The previous method of bulk sales would no longer do the job. National Biscuit Company needed a major step forward in packaging and created it with the \"In-er-seal\" package, an ingenious system of inter-folded layers of wax paper and cardboard. It was the first of many innovations in biscuit packaging.\nOver the next several decades National Biscuit Company, often referred to by the abbreviation N.B.C., grew by acquiring companies such as the F.H. Bennett Company, maker of Milk-Bone pet products, and the Shredded Wheat Company, maker of Triscuit wafers and Shredded Wheat cereal. During this time, the company was also busy developing numerous cookies and crackers, many of which continue to be family favorites, such as Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Honey Maid graham crackers.\nThe name Nabisco first appeared on a new sugar wafer product in 1901, but the corporate name did not change until 1971.\nBy the age of 29, James Lewis Kraft had experience in three business enterprises, including a cheese business based in Buffalo, NY. That year, 1903, while in Chicago managing the company's local branch, Kraft's business partners eased him out. Stranded in this city with a scant $65, Kraft quickly put his merchandising experience to work.\nHe noticed that local merchants had to travel to Chicago's wholesale warehouse district to buy the cheese they sold in their stores. So, Kraft used his meager capital to rent a horse and wagon, and each day purchased a stock of cheese to resell to the small storekeepers. The merchants appreciated the convenience, and Kraft prospered.\nBy 1909, his brothers Charles, John, Fred and Norman joined him, and they incorporated the business under the name of J.L. Kraft & Bros. Co., with J.L. Kraft as president.\nIn 1915, they began producing processed cheese in 3-1/2 and 7-3/4 ounce tins. J.L. Kraft's method of producing processed cheese was so revolutionary, in 1916 he obtained a patent for it. J.L. Kraft followed up on his success with processed cheese in tins by introducing or acquiring many additional products, including such familiar names as Velveeta process cheese, Philadelphia cream cheese, Miracle Whip salad dressing and Kraft macaroni & cheese dinner.\nHe used innovative advertising to promote his products and was a pioneer in the sponsorship of American television and radio shows. The company's \"hands\" commercials, showing a pair of hands preparing recipes using Kraft products, became a symbol of the company's advertising success.\nThe success of J.L. Kraft and his company was noted by Thomas McInnerney, founder of National Dairy Products Corporation. In 1930, Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation (as it was then called) was acquired by National Dairy Products Corporation. Kraft continued to operate as an independent subsidiary of National Dairy Products Corporation for many years, but eventually was absorbed into the operating structure of the parent company, which changed its name to Kraftco Corporation in the late 1960s, almost 16 years after J.L.’s death.\nMonsieur Jean-Romain Lefèvre arrived in the seaside town of Nantes, France in 1846 and opened a biscuit factory at number 5 rue Boileau. His unique cookies and pastries, often made from local ingredients, were an immediate success with the local citizens. In 1850, Jean-Romain Lefèvre married Mademoiselle Pauline-Isabelle Utile. They combined their lives - and their surnames - and Lefèvre-Utile biscuits were born.\nThe couple opened a beautiful new retail store at number 7 rue Boileau in a building adjacent to their factory. By 1880 the Lefèvre-Utile factory employed fourteen workers. In 1882 Lefèvre-Utile biscuits won a gold medal at the Nantes exposition. This medal crowned the career of Jean-Romain who died one year later. Pauline-Isabelle assumed management of the bakery after her husband’s death.\nThe family business soon passed to Jean-Romain and Pauline-Isabelle’s third son, Louis Lefèvre-Utile. In 1887 Louis, along with his brother-in-law Ernest Lefèvre, established the Lefèvre-Utile Company. They build a new biscuit factory using the most modern baking techniques. Louis also began devoting resources to advertising in order to promote LU biscuits. He appealed to the best graphic designers and painters of his day, such as Firmin Boisset and Alfons Mucha, who lend their talents to create exquisite publicity materials.\nIn 1897 LU introduced what would become its signature cookie -- Le Petit Êcolier “The Little Schoolboy.” This new product consists of a scalloped butter biscuit topped with fine chocolate imprinted with the schoolboy figure. By the end of the 19th century the sale of LU biscuits extended throughout France and several foreign markets. And the LU factory employed several hundred workers.\nIn 2007 Kraft Foods Inc. acquired Group Danone's global biscuit business including the market-leading LU brand. Today, LU biscuits continue to make life’s delicious little luxuries as they have for over 150 years.\nCarl Russ-Suchard was born in Solingen, Germany in 1838. In 1884, he took over the reins of Chocolat Suchard from his father-in-law, Philippe Suchard, who founded the chocolate factory in Neuchâtel, Switzerland in 1826.\nCarl Russ-Suchard had been experimenting for a long time on how to enhance the taste and consistency of chocolate bars - which were still quite bitter and hard in those days - by adding milk. At last, he succeeded in combining the cocoa mass with powdered milk that was extracted from Alpine milk. This was still an entirely innovative product at this time.\nWith the right intuition for the ingredients and an entrepreneurial, forward-looking vision, he was able to introduce a sustainable milk chocolate on the market with this process. In 1901, he created the renowned Milka chocolate with its one-of-a-kind lilac look, and he made it popular on a transnational level.\nUp until his golden years, Carl Russ-Suchard contributed his competence and experience to chocolate production.\nCarl Russ-Suchard passed away in 1925 at the age of 87.\nIn 1915, Holger Sørensen established a confectionery factory in Vejle, Denmark. His confectionery company named Vejle Caramel-og Tabletfabrik earned a reputation for high quality products. But Sørensen was always looking for new opportunities. At an exhibition in London, he noticed a new product – chewing gum. He bought the recipe and began experimenting with making chewing gum in his own kitchen. His first chewing gum, Vejle Tyggegummi, was introduced to the Danish market in January 1927 and became an instant success. Quality remained key for Holger Sørensen as it had from the start and continued as top priority for his chewing gum.\nIn 1939, the chewing gum maker adopted the name Dandy, and the Dandy brand name appeared for the first time.\nFollowing Holger Sørensen death in 1943, his son, Erik Bagger-Sørensen, took charge of the company along with his mother. After World War II, he gained sole responsibility for managing the company. With his talent for business, production, development and interest in trade and export, the Dandy company entered a period of dramatic development with new factories, export opportunities and new products. Stimorol, which would become Dandy’s most popular gum brand, was introduced in 1956.\nCadbury Schweppes acquired the branded chewing gum business of Dandy A/S from the Bagger-Sørensen family in 2002. The Dandy chewing gum brands at that time included Stimorol, V6 and Dirol.\nWhen he was just a little boy, Philippe Suchard, born in 1797 in Boudry in the Swiss canton of Neuenburg, already dreamed of producing chocolate someday himself.\nAt the age of ten he came into contact with chocolate for the very first time. At a pharmacist in Neuchâtel he went to buy a pound of chocolate - known as a “pick-me-up” at that time - as a medical remedy for his ailing mother. The expensive “medicine” cost him six francs. At that time this was equivalent to about three days wages for a laborer. On the way home, the ten-year-old dreamed about what it would be like to earn a living making chocolate.\nChocolate was Suchard's passion from then on. And a few years later, in 1814, he started an apprenticeship in confectionary with his older brother Frédéric in Berne.\nIn 1825, his childhood dream actually came true and he opened his own small confectionery business in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. He offered fine chocolate made by hand and laid the cornerstone for Suchard's success.\nJust about one year later, in 1826, he built his first chocolate factory on the banks of the Serriere River, in Neuchâtel-Serrières. With the help of a kneading and stamping machine fueled by hydropower, Suchard and his employee were able to produce 25 to 30 kilograms of chocolate per day. In 1880, the ambitious Suchard expanded further and opened his first factory abroad, in the German city of Lörrach.\nBy 1883 Chocolat Suchard was one of the largest chocolate companies in Switzerland, and Philippe Suchard was one of the most important chocolate manufacturers. Even today, his name and his products are well-known far beyond Switzerland.\nPhilippe Suchard passed away in 1884 at the age of 87.\nHenning Throne-Holst, the son of the founder of Norway’s Freia chocolate company, was commissioned by his father, Johan, to go to Sweden in 1916 and start a chocolate industry there named after the Freia company logo, the Marabou stork. At the young age of 23, he brought with him his father’s knowledge of the chocolate industry and his father’s dedication to quality.\nFreia had opened a very fashionable store on Oslo's main commercial street at th end of the previous century. The store radiated exclusiveness, with mahogany paneling, cut-glass chandeliers and velvet-covered chairs and sofas. The young Throne-Holst wanted Marabou to have something similar in Sweden. In the 1920’s Marabou acquired two stores in Stockholm, one in Gothenburg and one in Malmö. In those days, the best in interior decorating was supplied by the Swedish department store NK, which was commissioned to furnish these stores. The four stores reflected Marabou’s commitment to quality, not only in the furnishings but also in the service-mindedness of the staff. The stores catered to those who wanted fresh chocolate and something extra in the way of fancy hand-packed boxes.\nAlthough independent operations, the Freia and Marabou companies worked closely together over the years, and in 1990 Freia bought the Marabou chocolate business. Freia Marabou a/s thus became Scandinavia’s leading manufacturer of chocolate and sugar confectionery.\nOur Corporate Timelines\n1927 - American Chicle Company opens a factory in Mexico City.

The young men are just 25 and 21 years old respectively. They struggle to keep the business and work hard at promoting their goods to the trade. Their dedication, in addition to innovative new products and quality improvements, help the business survive and prosper.\n1866 - The turning point for the young Cadbury brothers is a new processing technique and the resulting product: Cadbury Cocoa Essence. The new cocoa press, purchased from a Dutch manufacturer, squeezes out much of the cocoa butter from the beans so it is no longer necessary to put starches in the cocoa. The Cadbury brothers are the first British chocolate manufacturer to use this new process. The marketing of Cadbury Cocoa Essence as “Absolutely Pure, Therefore Best” helped sales increase dramatically.\n1879 - Now employing 200 people, Richard and George Cadbury need a bigger factory. Instead of looking at another city location they chose a greenfield site four miles from the centre of Birmingham on what would be called Bournville Lane. There are practical business reasons why this site is appealing: canal and rail links, roads and water supply. Also, the workers can live in far better conditions than in the crowded slums of Birmingham. Production begins on this “factory in a garden” in September.\n1897 - Using left over cocoa butter from its drink powder, Cadbury produces its first milk chocolate bar for eating. However, the bar is dry and not sweet enough to be successful.\n1899 - Richard Cadbury dies and the business becomes a private limited company: Cadbury Brothers Limited.

        "Raw_Text": "ETHICS & COMPLIANCE PROGRAM\nOur Ethics & Compliance Program\nOur global Ethics & Compliance program helps guide our employees to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations while conducting business around the world. It also emphasizes conduct consistent with our commitment to act with integrity, as well as make ethical decisions for our business, our shareholders, our employees and our consumers, because their trust and confidence is critical to our success.\nTRAINING-CONTACT-ACTION – MAKING ETHICS & COMPLIANCE PART OF OUR CULTURE\nWe have a dedicated Ethics & Compliance team around the world (including regional Ethics & Compliance leads and subject matter experts) who work with senior management to implement our program. Our Ethics & Compliance team helps ensure our employees know what is expected of them and how to make the right decisions, especially when faced with difficult or complex situations. Our live and online training programs are deployed to employees on a rotating basis to reinforce core policies. The objective of our training is to help employees understand legal and ethical business practices via periodic global eLearnings (approximately four annually) and other region/market-led training sessions. Our global learning and awareness platform includes:\n- Code of Conduct\n- Anti-bribery\n- Anti-discrimination/harassment\n- Fair competition\n- Data privacy\n- Conflicts of Interest & Gifts\n- Sanctions Compliance\n- Customs & trade Laws\n- Anti-money laundering\n- Insider trading\nNew hires are mandated to complete eLearning across these important topics, provided in local language.\nOur global eLearnings target our broad employee base, while live sessions are targeted to risks specifically relevant to role and/or geography and also include part-time personnel. Code training is mandatory and deployed annually, while other mandatory compliance training programs generally follow a bi-annual cycle. Apart from formal training, we deploy global awareness campaigns on a quarterly basis to keep Compliance and ethical decision making fresh in our employee’s minds. These compliance awareness campaigns are intended to supplement our core trainings and respond to our evolving compliance risk landscape.\nAudit & Risk Advisory regularly conducts audits of the application of MDLZ anti-corruption policies in our operations, on a rotating basis and in consideration of evolving risks in markets where we operate. Generally three to four audits covering anti-corruption policies and processes are conducted annually.\nSPEAKING UP AND BEING HEARD\nWe expect and encourage employees to ask questions and raise concerns about business practices when they see something they think might be wrong. There may be times when employees are not comfortable speaking with their supervisors, Ethics & Compliance, Legal or human resources contacts, or simply wish to remain anonymous. Consistent with applicable local law, we have a toll-free, and in some countries a collect call/reverse charge telephone HelpLine and an online version WebLine so our employees can confidentially and, if they wish, anonymously report instances of suspected wrongdoing or ask questions about compliance matters. Our HelpLine operates in more than 90 countries. Toll-free numbers and dialing instructions can be found by selecting the country you are calling from on the Integrity WebLine page.\nLISTENING, INVESTIGATING, ACTING\nIn 2024, our Ethics & Compliance team received more than 2,800 contacts from around the world through our \"Speaking Up\" channels. These contacts included questions about our compliance policies and program or matters that we referred to other departments for handling. We received reports of misconduct that required investigation. Some of these matters resulted in disciplinary action, including the separation of people from the company when appropriate.\nREPORT TO MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD\nTo make sure that senior management and the Board of Directors are aware of any potentially significant matters, our Ethics & Compliance group reports investigations to members of our executive team and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nEXTERNAL REPORTS OF WRONGDOING\nReports from people outside of the company of suspected wrongdoing may also be brought to our attention in four ways:\nBy mail:\nEthics & Compliance Department\nMondelēz International, Inc.\n905 West Fulton Market, Suite 200\nChicago, IL 60607\nUSA\nBy e-mail: Compliance@mdlz.com\nThrough our Integrity HelpLine: Our Integrity HelpLine is a toll-free and/or reverse charge service operated for Mondelēz International by a third-party. The HelpLine is accessible 24 hours a day, every day, and language interpreters are available. These toll-free numbers and dialing instructions can be found by selecting the country you are calling from on the Integrity WebLine page.\nThrough our Integrity WebLine: Our Integrity WebLine is an online version of the HelpLine. It is operated by a third-party for Mondelēz International and is accessible 24 hours a day. You can visit www.mdlzethics.com to access the Integrity WebLine."

We call this Snacking Made Right.\nWe are committed to making our snacks the right way, protecting the planet and respecting the human rights of people in our value chain. Our Human Rights Policy uses the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) as a framework for preventing and mitigating human rights risks. The Policy is aligned with our Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct.\nWe undertake practical, proactive, and ongoing human rights due diligence to identify, mitigate and reduce the likelihood of potential and actual human rights impacts within our own operations, and work with our business partners in our supply chain to achieve the same. We strive to embed these due diligence practices at a central level, as well as at a local level in collaboration with our business units.\nOur Human Rights efforts include our signature programs Cocoa Life and Harmony, where we strive to make a positive impact on the farms, communities, and environment where our most important raw materials – cocoa and wheat – are grown.\nSince 2012, we have leveraged Cocoa Life, our holistic sustainability program which we are backing with a $400 million investment during the first 10 years, to address human rights risks associated with labor in the cocoa supply chain. To learn more about our ingredient supply chain check out our Sustainable Ingredients page.\nWe are committed to treating people fairly, through our Compliance & Integrity program, where we ensure the availability of accessible grievance mechanisms (e.g., Integrity HelpLine and WebLine) for our own employees, contractors, and subcontractors to use for raising any concerns and to better enable Mondelēz International to appropriately redress human rights impacts which we have either caused or contributed to.\nTo read more about our commitments and actions towards identifying and mitigating potential and actual Human Rights impacts within our own operations see our annual Human Rights Due Diligence report."

        "Raw_Text": "SUPPLY CHAIN EXPECTATIONS\nMondelēz International Supply Chain Expectations for Suppliers\nWe work with thousands of suppliers, consultants, and business partners around the world and this work has a direct impact on the communities we serve and live in.\nIdeally, Mondelēz International and our Suppliers and Partners will have comparably high standards of conduct. Of course, we cannot — and do not presume to — control how they run their businesses. But, as described below, we take five pragmatic steps to align what they do for us – and how they do it – with our own standards of fair and honest dealings.\nIn addition, to summarize our position and commitment to ethics, respect, and fairness, we established a Supplier & Partner Code of Conduct, underlining our desired ethical human and business practices. We encourage all our Suppliers & Partners to familiarize themselves with the Code, ask us about it and strive to align with it.\n1. SELECTION AND RISK ANALYSIS\nWe begin with the selection process. As we evaluate suppliers, we want to be familiar with their own codes of conduct and reputations, as well as their ability to deliver quality, service, and total value to Mondelēz International.\nBefore engaging in new business relationships – and during the course of business, we conduct appropriate and risk-based due diligence, which includes screening potential suppliers against restricted party lists from authorities worldwide and may include human rights related information. These systems support the identification of potential risks, help guide our approach for impact mitigation and monitoring, and inform our procurement practices.\nOur Supplier & Partner Code of Conduct is available on our Mondelēz International website for all our current and future business partners to consult.\n2. CONTRACTING: TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nOnce we determine a good fit with a supplier or business partner, we develop a contract that not only provides the core commercial terms but specifically incorporates mandatory terms and conditions in areas such as corporate social responsibility, ethics, integrity, and safety.\nIn addition to complying with all laws and regulations, suppliers must comply with Mondelēz International’s expectations in terms of:\n- Forced Labor\n- Child Labor\n- Diversity and Inclusion\n- Harassment and Abuse\n- Safety and Health\n- Third-Party Representation\n- Working Hours and Compensation\n- Disciplinary Procedures\n- Business Integrity\n- Environment and Sustainability\n- Anti-bribery\nAs part of our supplier agreements and embedded in our Purchase Orders, our suppliers understand and acknowledge that they will adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct.\n3. ASSESSING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY THROUGH \"PROGRESS\"\nWe are not alone in our approach as most major companies have supplier corporate responsibility requirements. Yet most companies are both suppliers and customers, leading to a proliferation of codes of conduct and assessment requests. We supported the creation of a superior approach for society called PROGram for RESponsible Sourcing (PROGRESS). This industry initiative allows a supplier to provide common information to its customers, so each customer can independently reach business decisions in accordance with its own corporate responsibility standards.\nWe are currently rolling out PROGRESS to our suppliers and business partners. This is an ambitious global effort that will take several years to complete. When dealing with such an important issue as corporate responsibility, we have taken a long-term approach that we are confident puts us on the right path.\n4. WORKING TOGETHER: SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY AND LABOR PRACTICES\nAs awareness and advocacy efforts around human trafficking and slavery grow among governments, NGOs, and investors, so do expectations for businesses to demonstrate how they address this issue within their supply chains.\nThe Mondelēz International Human Rights Policy guides our approach. In line with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657) and the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, our annual Human Rights Due Diligence & Modern Slavery Report provides more detail on our efforts to help make a difference in our operations and those of our suppliers.\nOur purchasing contracts require suppliers to comply with all laws and support Mondelēz International’s policies on child and forced labor. We have various tools to address non-compliance, which may include, but are not limited to, a corrective action plan. If the supplier does not resolve the issues of concern in a timely and satisfactory manner, Mondelēz International reserves the right to take more drastic action, such as termination of the business arrangement.\nSuppliers working with Mondelēz International are also expected to abide by our:\n5. VERIFICATION AND IMPROVEMENT: COMPLIANCE AUDITS\nFor our own operations and tier 1 suppliers, on an ongoing basis we seek to identify potential human rights issues, and monitor compliance with our policies and our corporate responsibility expectations through independent audits. We use the SMETA audit protocol to evaluate our internal manufacturing sites and direct suppliers against a common set of corporate social responsibility standards developed for the consumer goods industry.\nIn addition, we strive to address potential negative social and environmental impacts in our value chain, including our cocoa and palm oil supply chains, through our sustainability initiatives and multi-stakeholder collaboration with suppliers, industry peers, civil society, and government.
