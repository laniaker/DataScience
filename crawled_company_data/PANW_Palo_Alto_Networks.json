        "Raw_Text": "A LETTER FROM CHAIRMAN and CEO NIKESH ARORA\nTo Our Fellow Shareholders,\nAt Palo Alto Networks, we have always endeavored to become the ‘Cybersecurity Partner of Choice’ for our customers. In my seven-year journey here, we delivered new products in multiple categories, ensuring they are best-of-breed and well-integrated into a platform. We have made sure to build fast, integrate faster, and, if required, acquire innovation to become the platform of choice.\nOur strategy is working. We are positioned to become the first cybersecurity company to surpass $10 billion in annual revenue run-rate, while sustaining above-market growth. We’ve paired this with one of the highest free cash flow margins in the industry. This gives us the scale and capacity to continually invest ahead of the curve.\nBuilding on our foundation to double the business again\nAs we aim to continually serve our customers and double our business again in the next five years, we remain vigilant and recognize our future success will require us to enter and redefine new categories.\nOur market entry strategy has centered around the fundamental belief that the best time to enter a category is at the inflection point. For example, we entered the SASE category, positioning us to take advantage of the shift towards hybrid work, and we lead the industry today. We invested in endpoint security prior to pioneering the inflection point towards XDR, and have continued to develop a revolutionary platform to disrupt the Security Operations landscape with XSIAM. Our browser bet, was ahead of all market players racing to build browsers in the AI era.\nNow, we are witnessing another inflection point driven by the emergence of AI agents, creating new AI security categories and reshaping the way Identity Security is delivered, with a significant proportion of attacks driven by credential theft, we feel Identity Security needs to change.\nThe next inflection point in Identity Security and how CyberArk fits in\nAfter spending many years observing and studying the Identity Security landscape, the time is now to re-shape the $29 billion Identity Security category and lead from the front.\nOur belief is centered around three principles:\nConvergence of Identity and Security: Identity has historically been separated by Privileged Access Management (PAM) and Identity and Access Management (IAM). Basic hygiene was covered by IAM, while PAM, offering robust security, was limited to a small number of privileged users. Today, PAM can be deployed at the same cost as IAM. With nearly 90% of breaches involving stolen or mismanaged credentials, PAM is no longer a tool solely to monitor a small set of administrators. In the future - every user, machine and AI agent should be considered a \"privileged user\".\nThe Need for Platformization in Identity Security: The Identity Security category is highly fragmented with over one hundred vendors vying to capture the customer’s attention across multiple functional domains. These domains are converging as the complexity of stitching together disparate solutions and the rise in identity-related breaches push enterprises to favor better integration. We fundamentally believe the future of Identity Security is aligned with the vision that every identity requires the right level of privilege controls, and not the “IAM fallacy” and has to include the principles of Identity Governance and Administration in the same platform.\nThe Rise of Machine Identities and AI Agents: The rapid proliferation of machine identities is a widespread phenomenon across organizations in all industries. Today, the ratio of machines to humans in the enterprise is estimated to be 80:1. The rise of AI agents will only accelerate this further. AI agents can act unpredictably, potentially gaining unauthorized access and even exposing credentials. We firmly believe that AI agents will need to be treated as privileged users, as mere authentication provided by traditional IAM is insufficient.\nOur M&A philosophy and what led us to CyberArk\nFor each inflection point, we assess whether an opportunity disrupts existing technology, requiring new vendors to emerge, or can be addressed by the larger established players. When the inflection point requires an entirely new approach, we have more often favored smaller vendors.\nIn all cases, we look to acquire the leading technology and become a force multiplier through joint innovation and go-to-market efforts. In this instance, we believe 1) the large PAM vendors are best positioned to address emerging identity security needs, as the widespread deployment of AI agents makes privileged controls more important, and 2) that CyberArk is by far the category-leading technology.\nWe envision Identity Security becoming the next major pillar of our multi-platform strategy, complementing our leadership in Network Security, SASE, Cloud Security and Security Operations. We will work to seamlessly integrate these best-of-breed platforms to ensure customers can respond faster to rising AI threats.\nTo the CyberArk shareholders, we are delighted that your Board of Directors has unanimously approved moving forward with this proposed transaction. Over the past seven years, we have demonstrated an ability to generate outsized investor returns, built on core principles of product innovation, strong company culture, and delivering premium security outcomes for customers. We will take great care to preserve the value of the amazing asset that the CyberArk leadership team has built.\nOur transaction is the result of detailed conversations with the CyberArk leadership team to align the incentives of all stakeholders. We have reached an agreement to acquire CyberArk for $45.00 in cash and 2.2005 shares of Palo Alto Networks common stock for each CyberArk share, which represents a 26% premium to the unaffected 10-day average of the daily VWAPs of CyberArk as of Friday, July 25, 2025. Following the close of the transaction, we will optimize our combined go-to-market resources and continue to lead innovation. We believe this accelerates our mission to double the value of our joint businesses over the next five years.\nIn conclusion, we believe the combined company will become the cyber guardian for our customers, allowing them to focus on their core business objectives and adopting AI, furthering our mission for our customers - \"A world where each day is safer and more secure than the one before.\"\nOn behalf of all of us at Palo Alto Networks, thank you for your continued support in our vision and strategy.\nNikesh Arora\nChairman and CEO, Palo Alto Networks\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis letter relates to a proposed transaction between Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
