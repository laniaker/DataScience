        "Raw_Text": "Yanbing Li\nWe are thrilled to announce that, for the second consecutive year, Datadog has been named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Digital Experience Monitoring. We believe that this recognition reflects our continued focus on helping customers observe, secure, and act on everything that matters across their technology stack.\nDatadog’s unified observability and security platform breaks down silos across frontend, backend, and infrastructure—bringing business, DevOps, SRE, and security teams together to understand and optimize critical user journeys.\nBy providing deep visibility into user interactions and application performance, Datadog enables organizations to deliver consistent, reliable experiences across every touchpoint. As digital environments grow more complex, our AI-powered platform helps organizations stay ahead by automatically detecting anomalies, surfacing user friction through dead click tracking, and uncovering behavioral patterns with heatmaps. With integrated incident management and on-call workflows, teams can resolve issues faster and shift from reactive firefighting to proactive optimization to deliver digital experiences that strengthen customer satisfaction and business performance.\n- Real User Monitoring (RUM) provides full-fidelity visibility into every session, enabling accurate troubleshooting and performance insights while using dynamic retention filters to control costs.\n- Product Analytics empowers teams to make smarter product decisions by turning real user data, like adoption trends, user journeys, and in-app behavior, into quantitative insights that guide prioritization and improve digital experiences.\n- Session Replay captures user interactions and performance data across web and mobile, recreating sessions for end-to-end troubleshooting. Paired with RUM or Product Analytics, it connects technical performance to real user behavior, helping teams resolve issues faster and prioritize product decisions with richer insights.\n- Synthetic Testing and Monitoring integrates synthetic tests directly into your CI pipelines to catch issues early, ensuring your applications are issue-free before reaching end users.\n- Error Tracking automatically groups and surfaces critical errors to enable rapid issue resolution across your entire technology stack for more efficient troubleshooting.\n- Datadog’s AI engine provides automated alerts, insights, and root cause analyses that draw from observability data across the entire Datadog platform for faster resolution and improved user experiences.\n- Application Performance Monitoring and Software Catalog integrate seamlessly with RUM to provide a comprehensive view of your application, enhancing collaboration, incident management, and real-time insights with end-to-end service ownership.\n- Feature Flags give teams an integrated way to safely and confidently manage feature delivery, with real-time observability to track performance, detect regressions, and protect user experience. Sign up for the Preview now.\nAs we celebrate our second consecutive year as a Leader in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Digital Experience Monitoring, we remain committed to helping our customers stay ahead of complexity and deliver exceptional digital experiences. With AI-powered intelligence, scalable data collection, and built-in cost controls, Datadog DEM continues to evolve so your teams can innovate faster and with confidence.\n“It has been a long time since we’ve seen truly insightful data from customers. Datadog gave us that lens again,” said Mahmoud Abdel Gawad, Co-CEO at Ibnsina Pharma.\n“Datadog allows us to measure the business impact of changes and have a single point of truth across all teams,” said Zbigniew Kamiński, head of SRE at Booksy.\nWe believe that customer feedback is a core aspect of analyst reports, and we feel our recognition reflects the value that Datadog delivers to our users today along with our future investments across the platform.

Cut through the noise, simplify triage, and get to the root of issues faster.\nShip with confidence\nGet real-time alerts for new, recurring, and high-volume errors. Prioritize issues by impact so you can act early, prevent regressions, and protect the user experience without slowing down development.\nFix with context\nDebug without the guesswork. Use code-level context, telemetry like logs and environment data, and suspect commits to understand what caused the issue. With AI-powered insights and issue classification, you can resolve errors quickly and stay focused on building.\nGrow your product, not your tools\nStart with Error Tracking and expand into full observability all on a single platform.
