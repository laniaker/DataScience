Combined with a FortiGate NGFW, malicious network traffic is blocked before causing harm by threat actors seeking to control or disrupt operations. In addition, the service can act as a virtual patch to provide immediate security protection until a vendor patch can be developed and deployed.\nWestlands Advisory named Fortinet the overall leader for the third time in a row in their IT/OT Network Protection Platform Navigator 2025, ranked highest for Strategic Direction and Capability. Fortinet is the only vendor to have been ranked as a leader in every report since inception. Only Fortinet offers a single solution across IT and OT to better help reduce cyber risk across the entire organization, whether threats target the branch office, remote worker, or industrial/OT site.\nDownload ReportThe FortiGuard OT Security Service, deployed with FortiGate NGFWs and fueled by threat intelligence and a stream of new signatures from FortiGuard Labs, performs passive deep packet inspection (DPI) of your industrial network traffic to detect and block threats.\nThe FortiGuard OT Security Service offers protection for OT devices such as PLCs, RTUs, and HMIs and associated applications as a result of signature development conformant to common OT protocols.\nThe service can perform virtual patching of unprotected applications while awaiting a patch. Also, Fortinet works closely with automation and control system vendors to develop OT IPS signatures to address known vulnerabilities in their platforms.\nToday’s industrial cyber threats dictate that an OT/ICS IPS do more to protect an expanding network edge. The FortiGuard OT Security Service takes traditional OT/ICS IPS capabilities to the next level, providing coverage for the following use cases:\nOrganizations with plant, manufacturing, facilities, and other industrial networks can analyze network traffic at scale to detect and block both known and suspicious network-based attacks targeting their OT applications and devices.\nOrganizations can accelerate protection in near real-time across their broader security infrastructure, stopping further infection when a new threat is detected.\nOrganizations can shorten security exposures when vendor patches, and the time necessary to conduct the patch, are delayed."
