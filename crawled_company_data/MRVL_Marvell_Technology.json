        "Raw_Text": "Marvell Privacy Preference Center\nMarvell Privacy Policy\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. — September 2, 2025 – Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVL), a leader in data infrastructure semiconductor solutions, today announced the Marvell® Structera™ Compute Express Link® (CXL®) memory-expansion controllers and near memory compute accelerators have successfully completed interoperability testing with DDR4 and DDR5 memory solutions from industry leaders Micron Technology, Samsung Electronics, and SK hynix. This milestone follows the recent announcement “Successful Interoperability of Structera CXL Portfolio with AMD EPYC CPU and 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Platforms,” making Structera the only CXL 2.0 product family with completed interoperability testing across both leading CPU architectures and all three major memory suppliers.\nAs data-centric applications grow in complexity and memory plays a greater role in performance, interoperability is critical. Validation of Structera with DDR4 and DDR5 enables scalable system design, reduces integration risk, and streamlines qualification, while giving OEMs and cloud providers the flexibility to optimize system designs while maintaining supply chain flexibility.\nTo meet hyperscalers' demand for seamless integration across diverse memory and CPU technologies, Structera ensures compatibility and flexible configuration options that accelerate qualification and enable scalable deployment. A flexible business engagement model from Marvell enables innovative deployment strategies for Structera, allowing tailored product configurations that align with specific workload requirements and support both standard and custom deployment models.\nTo support diverse system architectures, Structera IP is available for integration into custom silicon designs. This allows customers to embed silicon-proven CXL technology from Marvell directly into their chips, unlocking new opportunities to optimize workload-specific performance, power efficiency, and system cost. The IP offering supports a broad range of integration models—from fully custom SoCs to tightly coupled accelerators—providing design flexibility while leveraging the mature CXL ecosystem and interoperability leadership developed by Marvell.\n“As AI and high-performance computing workloads intensify, CXL will help dissolve bottlenecks for demanding workloads that can consume upwards of hundreds of terabytes of memory capacity,” said Praveen Vaidyanathan, vice president and general manager of Cloud Memory Products at Micron. “Our collaboration with Marvell to validate Structera with Micron’s memory technology is expected to deliver scalable, high-efficiency CXL infrastructure for the new frontier of AI.”\n“CXL is reshaping how memory is deployed in data centers,” said Jangseok Choi, vice president at Samsung Electronics. “Our work with Marvell ensures that customers can confidently deploy Structera with Samsung DDR memory for reliable, high-performance systems.”\n“Working with Marvell to validate Structera with SK hynix memory supports our shared goal of making memory expansion more accessible and flexible,” said Uksong Kang, Head of Next Generation Product Planning and Enabling at SK hynix. “This gives customers the tools they need to build future-ready architectures with less friction and more choice.”\nThe Structera product line includes two CXL device families engineered to meet the diverse performance and scalability needs of next-generation cloud data centers. The Structera A CXL near-memory accelerators integrate 16 Arm® Neoverse® V2 cores and multiple memory channels with CXL to address high-bandwidth memory applications such as deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) and machine learning. The Structera X CXL memory-expansion controllers enable terabytes of memory to be added to general-purpose servers and address high-capacity memory applications such as in-memory databases. The Structera CXL device families are the industry’s first to support four memory channels, integrate inline LZ4 compression and use 5nm manufacturing processes.\nAbout Marvell\nTo deliver the data infrastructure technology that connects the world, we’re building solutions on the most powerful foundation: our partnerships with our customers. Trusted by the world’s leading technology companies for over 30 years, we move, store, process and secure the world’s data with semiconductor solutions designed for our customers’ current needs and future ambitions.

This innovation reduces interface power consumption by up to 75% with normal workloads and up to 42% during peak traffic periods.\nThe 64 Gbps bi-directional D2D interface IP also enhances performance and reliability with unique features such as redundant lanes and automatic lane repair, which improve yield and reduce bit-error rates by eliminating weak links in the system. Extending beyond the D2D PHY technology, Marvell delivers a complete solution stack—including the application bridge, link layers, and physical interconnect—providing customers with a turnkey platform to reduce time-to-market for next-generation XPUs.\n“The 64 Gbps bi-directional D2D interface IP marks an industry first and reflects our commitment to pioneering technologies that enhance performance while reducing total cost of ownership for next-generation AI devices,” said Will Chu, senior vice president of Custom Cloud Solutions at Marvell. “By delivering higher bandwidth at lower power, we are enabling customers to scale their architectures to meet the demands of tomorrow’s accelerated computing era.”\n“D2D interfaces—which form the backbone of the communications networks linking silicon die within the same device--are fundamental to increasing the performance and efficiency of data center semiconductors and especially the rapidly growing custom computing segment,” said Baron Fung, Senior Director of Research at Dell’Oro. “The advances achieved by Marvell are the latest step in the company’s strategy to develop a portfolio of technology to accelerate the development of custom devices as well as diversify the options available to semiconductor designers.”\nThe new 64 Gbps D2D interface technology builds on the proven Marvell track record of delivering industry firsts in advanced process technologies. In March 2024, Marvell became the first infrastructure silicon company to announce a 2nm platform. By March 2025, Marvell successfully demonstrated working 2nm silicon, followed shortly by the unveiling of its 2nm custom SRAM technology. Today’s introduction of the industry’s first 64 Gbps D2D interface in 2nm and 3nm nodes continues this momentum, underscoring Marvell as a leader in innovative solutions that define the future of accelerated infrastructure.\nMarvell Custom Strategy\nThe Marvell custom platform strategy seeks to deliver breakthrough results through unique semiconductor designs and innovative approaches. By combining expertise in system and semiconductor design, advanced process manufacturing, and a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor platform solutions and IP—including electrical and optical serializer/deserializers (SerDes), die-to-die interconnects for 2D and 3D devices, silicon photonics, co-packaged copper, custom HBM, system-on-chip (SoC) fabrics, advanced packaging, optical I/O, and compute fabric interfaces such as PCIe Gen 7— Marvell is able to create platforms in collaboration with customers that transform infrastructure performance, efficiency and value.\nAbout Marvell\nTo deliver the data infrastructure technology that connects the world, we’re building solutions on the most powerful foundation: our partnerships with our customers. Trusted by the world’s leading technology companies for over 30 years, we move, store, process and secure the world’s data with semiconductor solutions designed for our customers’ current needs and future ambitions.

        "Raw_Text": "Marvell Privacy Preference Center\nMarvell Privacy Policy\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. – August 18, 2025 – Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVL), a leader in data infrastructure semiconductor solutions, today announced that Microsoft has selected the Marvell® LiquidSecurity® family of hardware security modules (HSMs) for Microsoft Azure Cloud HSM.\nMarvell LiquidSecurity HSMs currently power Microsoft Azure Key Vault and Azure Key Vault Managed HSM services. With this expanded collaboration, Marvell will now also support Azure Cloud HSM.\nAzure Cloud HSM is a highly available, single-tenant service that allows customers to manage cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations within their own dedicated, cloud-based HSM cluster. FIPS 140-3 Level 3 certified, Azure Cloud HSM gives customers secure, direct, end-to-end encrypted access over a private, dedicated link from their virtual network.\nHSM-as-a-service market revenue is expected to grow at 8.5% per year through 20291.\n“We are excited to extend our collaboration with Microsoft on the Microsoft Azure Cloud HSM service with Marvell LiquidSecurity HSMs,” said Will Chu, senior vice president and general manager of Custom Cloud Solutions at Marvell. “Together, we share a vision to modernize the HSM market and enable Azure customers to leverage the latest security standards for the most demanding, cloud-scale applications.”\n“Many customers require administrative control of their HSMs, but don't want the overhead and ancillary costs that come with managing high availability HSM clusters on their own,” said Soumya Subramanian, vice president of Cloud Security Engineering at Microsoft. “Through our longstanding collaboration, we are able to offer Microsoft Azure customers the most secure and compliant key management services available in public, sovereign or government clouds today.”\n“Cloud continues to drive the pace in HSM spending as service providers work to ensure that the underlying infrastructure can support the growing demands of confidential computing and cloud sovereignty,” said Michela Menting, senior research director at ABI Research. “Marvell, which pioneered the category of cloud-optimized HSMs and remains the leader in the category, is poised to play a significant role in this evolution.”\nA critical element of global commerce, HSMs perform the authentication and encryption processes behind securing data at rest and in motion, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), sign-in services and other transactions. HSMs have historically been packaged as 1U and 2U server appliances running standard microprocessors and managed by HSM users within their own data centers.\nMarvell LiquidSecurity HSMs, by contrast, are PCIe-based devices tailored for dense multi-tenant cloud environments.\nPowered by optimized OCTEON® DPUs, a single LiquidSecurity2 card can manage 100,000 pairs of encryption keys and process more than one million operations per second. As a result, cloud service providers can deliver HSM services while consuming a fraction of the power, rack space and hardware required by traditional HSMs. Meanwhile, HSM users can switch from the complexity of managing hardware to the ease of subscribing to HSM services. The cloud-based model for HSMs also reduces barriers to employing HSM and encryption services for secure medical records and other transactions.\n1.

The process considered both the actual and potential financial effects of the topics on the business’ ability to create long-term value. It also considered the company’s resulting impact on the environment, society and economy.\nEngagement is important, as it enables us to understand the perspectives of internal and external stakeholders who are critical to our business. We aim to consider their needs and concerns across a wide range of regular touchpoints.\nWe have embedded accountability and oversight for sustainability at all levels of our organization. Governance oversight starts at the very top of our organization, with the Marvell Board of Directors overseeing the company’s efforts to mitigate impacts, manage risks, identify opportunities and achieve our goals related to sustainability.\nMarvell actively manages sustainability risks as part of our broader corporate risk management efforts. This process starts during the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. Our ERM program is led by the Chief Security Officer and the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), to identify, evaluate and manage risks across business functions. The ELT performs a risk assessment periodically and discusses the results with the Audit Committee. Risk mitigation strategies are also updated regularly, based on emerging threats and changes in the business environment, and feed into the Marvell Enterprise Resiliency Program to improve alignment and coordination within the company.\nThese cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off.

We start with the tone from the top, and we expect all employees to conduct themselves with uncompromising ethics and integrity.\nOur Core Behaviors\nOur ethics are guided by our core behaviors, which define who we are as a company and how we conduct ourselves within the organization and with our external stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, peers, shareholders and communities.\nACT WITH INTEGRITY AND TREAT EVERYONE WITH RESPECT\n- Say what you mean, do what you say\n- Be inclusive and embrace our diversity of people and opinions\n- Lying and arrogance are unacceptable\nEXECUTE WITH THOROUGHNESS AND RIGOR\n- Make decisions objectively based on data\n- Strive for excellence and minimize waste, delays and inconsistency\n- Deliver superior quality on time\nINNOVATE TO SOLVE CUSTOMER NEEDS\n- Understand the customers’ needs and focus innovation to make them successful\n- Be creative – take calculated risks and learn from failures\n- Build close and trusted customer relationships and be easy to do business with\nHELP OTHERS ACHIEVE THEIR OBJECTIVES\n- One Marvell – put Marvell objectives ahead of individual or team objectives\n- Act like an owner of the entire business\n- Share information, resources, technology and opportunities across the organization\nTalent Attraction, Retention, Development and Engagement\nAt Marvell, we seek to bring to life our employee value proposition to “Own What’s Next.” To enable the cutting-edge advances our sector requires, we have a range of programs to attract and retain the best talent, develop our people and build a great place to work that is centered around employee well-being.\nInclusion & Diversity\nWe strive to build a workplace where every individual feels valued, authentically themselves and empowered to contribute their unique insights and talents. Together, we create a thriving environment of belonging that drives innovation, collaboration and excellence.\nCommunity Engagement\nContributing to local communities and supporting meaningful causes allows our employees to make a positive impact, fostering a sense of connection and purpose. Our community engagement pillars include Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education; humanitarian endeavors; and giving back to communities.\nOur Environmental Impact\nClimate\nAddressing climate change is a key priority for Marvell and our stakeholders—especially our customers. While our offices, data centers and R&D labs account for less than 1% of our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, most of our carbon footprint stems from Scope 3 emissions linked to our supply chain and the use of sold products.\nWater and Waste\nWhile water use and waste generation in our direct operations are minimal, we recognize that even small impacts matter. As a company powering the future, we believe our offices and facilities should be ready for the future. Our Global Workplace Guidelines help integrate energy, water and waste considerations into new site selection and leasing decisions, supporting our company-wide sustainability goals."

This focus is both an environmental imperative and a key competitive advantage, as energy costs represent a substantial expense for our customers.\nThe semiconductor industry uses a wide range of materials in its products for their electrical properties, with some materials that are heavily regulated due to their adverse impact on human health and the environment. We are committed to complying with all relevant laws and conduct thorough due diligence during product design and development prior to mass production.\nTo gain a deeper understanding of greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water hotspots during our product manufacturing process, we conduct life cycle assessments (LCAs). These LCAs enable us to pinpoint and prioritize opportunities to reduce the upstream environmental impact of our products.\nSecurity is a cornerstone of our product development strategy. We rigorously assess security requirements from the earliest stages of innovation and integrate robust security measures throughout the entire development process. This comprehensive approach safeguards our intellectual property, as well as our hardware and software products, against external threats and unauthorized access both during and after deployment.\nThese cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off.

We are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) nonprofit, the world’s largest industry coalition dedicated to supporting responsible supply chains. We view our supplier relationships as partnerships, emphasizing open communication, collaboration and capacity building.\nProtecting human and labor rights within our operations and supply chain is fundamental to our business. We adhere to rigorous standards, policies, and practices, including due diligence, stakeholder engagement and grievance mechanisms. We communicate our policies and expectations and engage in dialogue to foster continuous improvement, including the Marvell Supplier Code of Conduct, Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy and the Marvell Global Human Rights Policy.\nThe semiconductor manufacturing process is an energy-intensive stage of the product life cycle. At Marvell, emissions from our direct manufacturing suppliers, such as foundries and outsourced product assembly and testing, account for over 98% of our upstream GHG emissions. By collaborating with our suppliers on GHG emissions reduction, we aim to enhance climate resilience and drive decarbonization across the entire value chain, benefiting both our suppliers and customers.\nThe semiconductor industry relies heavily on water, consuming billions of gallons annually. To use water responsibly in our supply chain, we have integrated water-related criteria into our supplier requirements, aligned with the RBA Code of Conduct, and we take a context-based approach that considers the geographic location of water use and local\nwater conditions.\nThese cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off.
