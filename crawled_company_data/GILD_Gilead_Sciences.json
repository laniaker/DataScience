        "Raw_Text": "The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) requires that every manufacturer of a product that is subject to a consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation enforced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issue a general conformity certificate that certifies that the product (the child-resistant package) complies with all applicable regulations. This requirement applies to products that are imported into or domestically manufactured in the United States.\nThe Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) applies to all Gilead products. The certificate must certify that based on a reasonable test program, the package complies with PPPA rules, bans, standards, and regulations.\nThe certificate must accompany each shipment of product. The CPSC permits electronic certificates to satisfy this requirement. An electronic certificate will be deemed to accompany a shipment if the certificate can be accessed via a world wide web URL or other electronic means as soon as the product enters domestic commerce or in the case of imports, when the product is available for customs inspection into the United States.\nThe details and requirements of the general conformity certificates under the CPSIA are published in 16 C.F.R. Part 1110 Certificates of Compliance.
