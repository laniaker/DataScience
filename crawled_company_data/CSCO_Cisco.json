Today SASE is best represented by the convergence of cloud-managed SD-WAN and cloud-delivered security.\nMoving to a SASE model will be a gradual process as IT rethinks how to connect a remote workforce to the distributed information resources they need. There will also likely be an increasing demand for \"as-a-service\" procurement models that offer more flexibility.\nSD-WAN is a cloud-delivered, overlay WAN architecture that provides the building blocks for cloud transformation at enterprises. It helps ensure a predictable user experience for applications and provides a seamless multicloud architecture while integrating robust, best-in-class security.\nSecurity Service Edge is the portion of the SASE architecture that provides a converged set of security services delivered and managed from the cloud to defend against threats and enforce user, data, and application policies. It helps you better manage security by extending controls to devices, remote users, and distributed locations anywhere in minutes.\nZero trust network access verifies users' identities and establishes device trust before granting them access to authorized applications.
