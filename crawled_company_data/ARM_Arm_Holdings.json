Tech Unheard is a lively podcast series that lets you listen in on one-on-one conversations with industry leaders as they discuss everything from the potential of artificial general intelligence (AGI) to keynote nerves.\nRene and his guests explore the drivers behind each leader’s path and analyze the most pressing trends in their space—all while sharing a few entertaining anecdotes of success and failure along the way.\nSubscribe now on:\nAshwini Vaishnaw: On India’s Path to “Tech Powerhouse”\nAshwini Vaishnaw has a unique background for a Member of the Indian Parliament: before he entered the government, he was an engineer. Now he brings that experience to bear as India’s Minister for Railways, Information & Broadcasting, and Electronics & Information Technology.\nIn this conversation, recorded on location at Arm’s new Bengalaru office, the minister tells Rene about India’s semiconductor initiative and other national programs driving technological and economic growth.\nRene Haas [0:08]\nWelcome to Tech Unheard, the podcast that takes you behind the scenes of the most exciting developments in technology. I’m Rene Haas, your host and CEO of Arm.\nToday, we have a very special episode for you. I’m in Bangalore, India, joined by Ashwini Vaishnaw, the Indian government’s Minister for Railways, Information & Broadcasting and Electronics & Information Technology. Under his leadership, India’s electronics manufacturing and exports have grown notably and the country’s first domestically produced semiconductor chip was released this fall.\nMinister, thanks so much for joining me.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [0:45]\nThank you.\nRene Haas [0:46]\nPleasure to have you. And you joined us today for this grand opening, which was also pretty amazing. Have you done many of these grand openings of offices across India recently?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [0:56]\nNot many, but Arm is special, so I had to be here. And good thing is that you're doing two nanometer design here. So that makes it a very special occasion for me, so that's why I came here.\nRene Haas [1:10]\nYeah. So there's a lot of things I want to talk to you about. There’s some amazing things going on with Indian economic growth, the things that are going on with semiconductor initiatives in India, which has a long and rich history. But maybe I want to start, Minister, with your background, and your background is unique. You've been in the technology space, you've been in the private sector, but now you're a high-ranking official in the Indian government. So, tell us a little bit about your journey and how you got to where you are.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [1:34]\nIt's an interesting journey. And see, I started as an engineer. I studied electronics and communication, and during college itself, I got hooked to semiconductors. And in fact, we somehow got one chip in our college and invented – used that to invent a network printer, way back, that’s a long, long time.\nRene Haas [1:55]\nAnd what were you programming the 8085 in?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [1:57]\nThat was hex.\nRene Haas [1:59]\nThe hex assembly? My goodness.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [2:02]\nIt was very, very difficult and it required so much focus, I remember.\nRene Haas [2:05]\nYou probably still remember some of the commands, I would imagine. I still remember some from 8080. So, you studied engineering in university…\nAshwini Vaishnaw [2:12]\nCorrect. Did my MTech at IIT Kanpur and during MTech, again was very fortunate to work on transformer for text-to-sound. Actually, I designed a card which was manufactured by Intel and then I had to write the entire database management system, because there was no DBMS which would take sound as a data element. So, it was very interesting and very kind of – at that point of time, probably a very unique project. Then I got into government, worked as an IAS officer, which is a challenging task in our country, managed.\nRene Haas [2:45]\nAnd what is that – for our listeners who may not know, what is an IAS officer?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [2:51]\nSo I’m sure people in India would understand. Outside India, one example I can give is like managing a complete district in India, maybe having like 1.4 million people, kind of thing. Having one large city or two large cities, and many small villages. So managing that, practically every aspect of governance comes to you, so that's very interesting. Then I worked in the Prime Minister's office, and then I went to Wharton and did my MBA, studied finance there, and came back and had a good entrepreneurial and corporate journey. And our Prime Minister gave me this very big opportunity in 2019. He got me into the parliament, and gave this big responsibility.\nRene Haas [3:37]\nSo you were designing text-to-sound, you were working on a network printer. You got your degree, your masters, yet you moved into government. What drove that choice for you at the time?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [3:51]\nA lot of things happen in our lives which are driven by the context and the society of that period. A large part of it was driven by my family. My father wished me into civil services, but I was more inclined towards technology.\nRene Haas [4:06]\nAnd were there aspects of your engineering background that when you got into civil service that helped you? Engineers are known to be very, very logical folks. Were there aspects of it when you look back that served you well?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [4:21]\nIt served me very well, because engineering gives you that logical way of thinking, that problem-solving mindset comes when you do engineering training and that really helped me. In fact, in one example I can give is the ‘99 super cyclone which came on the east coast of India. At that time, I was serving in a district called Balasore. I practically went into the computers of NASA. And got a lot of good data and collected that together and could predict the path of the cyclone. So that really helped.\nRene Haas [4:52]\nYeah. The thing that I'm just so impressed with is - and we’ll talk about your role now - is that having that engineering training, both in terms of your education and doing work in the private sector, has you rather uniquely positioned to understand the needs of the marketplace.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [5:07]\nIt helps me understand it. It also helps me engage well with the technical world. One can understand the challenges that we would face and one can foresee the entire spectrum of the issues that you’d face.\nRene Haas [5:20]\nSo, tell the world that's listening here, your role now, what you do inside of Parliament for the Ministry. You've got - your title’s rather unique in terms of the areas you look after, which are quite large and broad, but tell folks a bit about what you're doing.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [5:35]\nSo currently I've got three responsibilities. One is electronics and IT, where we basically are focused on manufacturing, on developing solutions for digital public infrastructure, and on creating the semiconductor ecosystem in our country – that is one, and the AI piece of it, AI mission. Second is railways where we have a very large network, which is more than 150 years old. A large population uses railways, so modernizing that entire network, getting it up to speed towards today’s technologies. And third is information and broadcasting.\nRene Haas [6:13]\nSo let's talk about semiconductors. I started my career in the middle 1980s and at that time, Japan was overtaking the United States and having a national policy on semiconductors was extremely important. And the U.S. started a consortium back in the day to address that. And then there was a period, I think, when the Internet boomed, that semiconductors weren’t seen as so interesting anymore – national policy waned and there wasn't as much attention given to it. Now the world has changed for a myriad of things. When you think about it in your role, what are the things that come to mind in terms of how you think about semiconductors, both in terms of the importance to India as a country, but also how you think about a national policy?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [6:57]\nSo if you look at it, any country which wants to be a significant player in the world must have good command over certain technologies. Semiconductor is one of them, quantum is another. getting the capabilities to work on those technologies. Telecom is another. So it's very important that we have significant capabilities in these technologies. That's the way we look at semiconductor as a major technology in our entire constellation of spectrum of technologies that we are forming. We have very strong design capabilities in our country. Close to one-fifth of the design talent is here in India, globally. So, every large global semiconductor company has a good presence here.\nRene Haas [7:47]\nSome of our best people working on the most advanced products for Arm are here.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [7:51]\nCorrect. And really advanced chips like two nanometer, three nanometer, some of the advanced nodes are being designed here. Based on this design capability, we want to now get into the manufacturing. So fab, ATMP, the capital equipment, the materials, and the finished product, which is electronics, right? This entire spectrum we are working on. So, in the case of semiconductors, we definitely want to have a good design ecosystem, further develop startups which can be – basically, which become product companies. And we want to do fabrication and manufacture of chips. We want to do ATMP. We already have ten units under construction at this point of time as we speak. Two of them are fabs and eight are ATMP units. We want to also manufacture the equipment which goes into manufacturing chips.\nRene Haas [8:43]\nAnd, sorry to interrupt you, Ashwini, but you started in 2019 in this role. When did you start to put in place this thinking about, we need a national policy around semiconductors?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [8:53]\nSo our semiconductor mission was inaugurated on the first of January 2022.\nRene Haas [8:59]\nOkay.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [9:00]\n2021 is when our Prime Minister approved the semiconductor mission. And then first January 2022, we started the mission. And in three and a half years, we have made significant progress.\nRene Haas [9:11]\nAnd here, relative to – here being in India – how does the government get involved relative to the private sector, the university system, to distill that mission into these partners to help build the ecosystem. How does that happen here?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [9:27]\nSo the mission is run by professionals, technical people, people who understand semiconductors very well. They are the ones who are running the entire mission, it’s run in a very professional and transparent manner. Our interaction is with multiple stakeholders, with the chemical, the gas manufacturers, the equipment manufacturers, the designers. In terms of universities, we have tie-ups – within the country, we are developing a very large talent pool, 278 universities we are working with.\nRene Haas [9:59]\nSo, 278 universities in India. And how does the government organize that effort with the universities, how does that take place?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [10:07]\nSo, we have a body called AICTE – All India Council for Technical Education. That's the coordinating body. Under the semiconductor mission, we have provided free-of-cost access to the world’s best EDA tools to the students studying in these universities. Basically, we would like our students to come out of the college well-prepared for the industry and also having that edge over other parts of the world.\nRene Haas [10:33]\nYeah. That's fantastic. And the vision is not just designing chips, but your vision is to go very, very broad with this.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [10:42]\nOur Prime Minister gave us the mandate to develop the entire ecosystem. So, we want to manufacture chips, we want to manufacture the equipment which goes into manufacturing chips, and we want to manufacture the materials which go into manufacturing chips. So, the complete ecosystem we are working on.\nRene Haas [10:57]\nThose are bold ambitions, and I think they're the right ones. When you think about the headwinds, things that make that challenging, what comes to mind?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [11:05]\nWhen you start any industry, there certainly would be many challenges. And when we started this journey, I remember my first interactions with the semiconductor professionals on the west coast of the U.S. – I met about 45 top CEOs and CTOs – and each time my pitch used to be: “We are starting a new industry and I don’t know anything. So please help us understand what this industry is and what we should be doing.” And everybody guided us very well and I must thank each one of those 45 CEOs who helped us think through the challenges. And we meticulously looked at each and every challenge, and: “Okay, this is a problem about power supply, let's find out how do we mitigate this.” “This is a problem about a particular very high ultra-pure chemical, let's find out how to mitigate that risk.” And methodically we have been working.\nRene Haas [11:58]\nSo, semiconductor investment for the type that you're talking about is not a one-year thing. It's not a two-year thing. It's a decades kind of thing. How do you ensure that the momentum lasts decades, given the fact that you're in a country here in India that has elections, government leadership could change. How do you think you maintain that sort of “stick-to-it-iveness”, if you will, relative to continuing that journey?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [12:27]\nBy having a very large ecosystem and a very large number of stakeholders. One good thing about our country is once we take a direction, the momentum once it builds up, it remains maintained for a very long period of time. And when you have a very large ecosystem where everybody is partner in the program, then it helps in creating that sustainability.\nRene Haas [12:49]\nAre there parts of the ecosystem that you think need more investment relative to the semiconductor vision?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [12:56]\nI think the chemical and gas part will require a lot more attention. Because the ultra-pure chemicals which are required in manufacturing chips will require a lot more capabilities than we have.\nRene Haas [13:09]\nYeah, I think from a talent standpoint, certainly speaking for Arm, we're – not only we have a huge presence here, but some of our best people are here. I think that there's such a rich talent base of engineers here and also entrepreneurs who are here and who have moved to other parts of the world and come back – I feel like talent is not an issue, but maybe I'm not thinking about it the right way. Do you think…\nAshwini Vaishnaw [13:34]\nThere are two parts to this question. Basically, the talent which designs and the talent which works in the clean rooms. So, we are working on both parts of it. The design part is – that pool is already available and there's a very large number of those. But the clean room, the people who currently work in fab, that’s where we are currently focused on, so that we get the right people.\nRene Haas [13:56]\nNow semiconducting, I want to come back to it, but I want to talk a little bit about India's economic growth and where that's going. It's obvious to anyone who comes here, and you and I were just remarking, looking outside this beautiful new office here, you could be anywhere in the world when you looked out at these gleaming buildings. It feels like this nation is on the cusp of some hyper-growth. Tell us a little bit about how you think about the growth engine of India.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [14:19]\nSo, it's a very well thought through strategy that we are executing. Our Prime Minister has given us a very clear way forward. It's basically built on four pillars. The pillar number one isinvestment in physical infrastructure as well as investment in digital and soc al infrastructure. Pillar two is about focus on manufacturing and innovation. Pillar three is inclusive growth and pillar four is simplification of so many processes and legal systems that we have. All the four pillars we are working in a very methodical way. We used to do public investment of about $30, 35 billion U.S. dollars ten years ago. Now we do about $140 billion dollars, and –\nRene Haas [15:02]\nAnd so that’s capital investment in –\nAshwini Vaishnaw [15:05]\nIn railways, highways..\nRene Haas [15:08]\n$140 billion dollars.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [15:09]\n– Power, in building new universities, improving the suburban transportation, so many other things. The second part is focus on manufacturing and innovation. So starting from just about 300, 400 startups ten years ago, today we have more than 130,000 startups in our country and more than a hundred unicorns. We are today the third largest startup ecosystem. And Make in India, which is part of the second pillar, we are focused a lot on manufacturing practically everything. So electronics manufacturing, we have grown six times. Electronics exports, we have grown eight times. Telecom equipment, we always used to import ever since the 1950s, and now we are a major exporter of telecom equipment. Defense equipment, we used to import, now we’ve become an exporter. So, all those things are very much well-thought through part of the second pillar of manufacturing and innovation. Third is inclusive growth. We are a very diverse country, culturally, linguistically, economic growth level, all those things. So, we are very, very keen on making sure that the people at the bottom of the pyramid, they get significantly good opportunities to come up, and the economy, the entire society and the country should rise up as a good harmonious way. So many programs, for example, opening 540 million new bank accounts. And so that's huge, right? And any sector, like 130 million households getting tap water connection. 40 million houses built for the poorer sections of the society. It’s a very, very wide program, which we have taken up. Fourth is simplification, we have removed about 1,500 laws from the statute book and about 35,000 compliances from the system, and still that's a work in progress. We are still working towards simplifying the system. So, it's a very well thought through strategy. I can say with a high level of confidence that we'll continue to grow in the band of 6-8% over the next few years and then move higher in that band with very moderate inflation.\nRene Haas [17:25]\nThat's just amazing. And removing all those processes is somewhat music to my ears. I want to talk about AI for a bit – to what level does AI accelerate that? Both in terms of the technology, and then I'm very curious about how you in your role view using AI to enable some of the changes you're talking about.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [17:47]\nIndia is an early adopter of AI. We are using AI in practically every sector of the economy today. We also have set up an AI mission. That mission basically does three major things. First is provide common compute facilities to our youngsters, to our startups and researchers.\nRene Haas [18:08]\nSo wait, what does that mean, common compute?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [18:11]\nSo if you look at the world, access to technology is limited to a few. So for example, in the case of semiconductors, we provided EDA tools to a very large population of students. Similarly, we are providing GPUs, 38,000 of them, to the students, the researchers, startups. So that common compute facility we created using government funds. And we are developing our LLMs, five teams are working on it. Then we have set up an AI Safety Institute, which is working in a very interesting network approach, which is developing a techno-legal solution to AI safety. We are developing many AI-based applications for our agriculture, education, healthcare, climate-related applications. So, it’s a very comprehensive program.\nRene Haas [19:00]\nOn the techno-legal approach towards AI, what does that mean exactly in terms of…techno-legal?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [19:08]\nSo we think that something as complex as AI cannot be dealt with simply by passing a law, by legislating something. It has to be solved in a more practical way. The practical way, we think, is to develop technical solutions and complement that with the legal structure. That’s the way we are thinking and – so for example, detecting a deep-fake. How do you detect a deep-fake? So, we have IIT Jodhpur working on a technical solution to detect deep-fake with a very high level of certainty. So that's an approach. And we have taken many institutions as a part of this network, rather than some of the countries or some other geographies without taking any names, I would say that they just want to legislate something and believe that the problem will be solved. The problem has to be solved in a more practical way.\nRene Haas [20:02]\nCan it be solved through a sovereign cloud where you have control of the models, controls of the weights? Or is your view that the world is flat when it comes to this and these AI models cross national boundaries? And this is a global coordination that’s required around AI?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [20:21]\nAbsolutely, it's indeed a global coordination that we will require, because the digital world doesn’t have physical boundaries. So I think the good part of new technology will be harnessed by our corporations, by our people, by our startups. But the harmful things will have to be globally coordinated and to me, it appears that over the period of the next few years, the world will come to a level of understanding where people will sit together and look at solving this safety part in a more coordinated way.\nRene Haas [20:55]\nAre you an “AI for good” – are you a bear or a bull when it comes to the benefits of AI?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [21:02]\nI believe that technology does bring a lot of good things to the society, it can help us solve population-scale problems. For example, one of the applications we have is aimed at detecting tuberculosis. And it’s very effective.\nRene Haas [21:16]\nAbsolutely.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [21:17]\nAnother one that we are working on is improving the productivity of our agriculture. And the results are phenomenal. So, I'm very practical, very rational on this topic. I would say that, let’s harness the benefits and let’s keep our society safe from the harms.\nRene Haas [21:32]\nAre you surprised at how fast it has moved in terms of, we had our ChatGPT moment a couple years ago and the advancement relative to whether it's video, whether it’s voice, queries… Are you surprised at how fast it’s moved?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [21:50]\nI think the trend is very clear. If you look at a few decades ago, the technology cycle used to be a few years. Then it shrunk to a couple of years, three years. Then it shrunk to like one year you have a totally new technology. So, the technology cycles have really, really shrunk in the past, so one can really anticipate that the growth which is seen today will continue.\nRene Haas [22:13]\nA lot of talk about “it's moving so fast and then there’s going to be a wave of jobs that are just going to get eliminated”. And then there are folks who say with every technological advancement, there's always jobs that go away, but there are more jobs that are created as a result. And then folks say, “well, no, this time it’s different because AI can think, AI can do the kind of jobs that certain trained white-collar workers could have done”. Is it something at the government level here in India, it’s talked about and thought about, I’m wondering?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [22:43]\nWe definitely are concerned about the change which is happening in the economy because of AI and the potential disruptions in employment. Yes, that's a major point. And we think that the solution to that is to upskill our people very rapidly. We think that, for example, the large number of students that we are training in 5G technologies and the large number of people that we are training in semiconductors, that same scale we must train our people in AI, both in the use, as well as in development. In fact, we have taken up a program for a million technical persons to be trained in AI-related technologies.\nRene Haas [23:25]\nAnd what would be examples of those AI?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [23:29]\nMultiple things. At a very basic level, making sure that the data annotation capabilities are there. At a mid-level, making sure that the applications can be created in India, for the world. And at a bigger level, on the research side.\nRene Haas [23:45]\nYeah. At Arm, and I think really across semiconductor companies, we're seeing productivity gains from AI, there's no doubt about it. But still finding very skilled engineers to do complex work around chip design, particularly some of the most complex chips in the world, we still see a need for a lot of engineers, as evidenced by all the growth here. Do you have a viewpoint on that, when you think about the semiconductor world, is AI – do jobs start going away in semis with AI?\nAshwini Vaishnaw [24:14]\nI think the change will be there, I think the change will bring many good aspects, and there will be some parts of it which will require a lot of adjustment. What’s your view on this? Because you see the entire world from your perch.\nRene Haas [24:27]\nWell, you know, I view AI as sort of this Star Trek thing that I did not think in my lifetime I would be able to work on it, from the perspective of, “can machines think and solve problems?” I think so long as ideas can be created to create new things, then I'm not so worried about where jobs go. It gets interesting though, when the AI gets smart enough to figure out, “here's the next thing you should do relative to developing a product or solving a problem.” Then I think it gets interesting. I am very much “AI for good,” as you are as well. I think healthcare is the killer app. When you look at the amount of time it takes to do a drug trial or genomic research, having that accelerated to an incredible level is pretty, pretty amazing. What the world looks like in 50 years? That's a great question. I would have thought that would have been a question years ago, we would have said, “well, it’ll kind of look the way it does today.” I think that time has shrunk. I think in 10 to 20 years, it’s going to be a very fascinating world. But chips will be at the heart of it, there's no doubt about it. So, what you guys are doing here in terms of your policy is the right one.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [25:41]\nWhat’s the change in the semiconductor industry that you think – what’s the trend that you see where a country like us where we are starting a new industry, we should be thinking about?\nRene Haas [25:53]\nYeah, so in India, I think, there's so much potential to create the world’s next great geography for everything you’ve talked about, because you have access to a gigantic talent pool, you have access to resources, even rare earth-type minerals you have huge access to. So there's no reason over time, India cannot become a great dominant player in terms of the whole vertical infrastructure, which is why I find what your policies are behind to be so exciting, and it’s so fascinating, you’ve gone off and had these discussions with all the different CEOs, you said, on the West Coast. To be sitting here with a minister who can talk about Synopsys and Cadence EDA tools and understand where those are, that’s a huge jump because when it starts at the top, relative to an understanding of the details, is a very significant thing. So, I'm very excited by it. And when I come here to our office in Bangalore and I see the energy level and the passion of people to create and invent, like you said, there’s an entrepreneurial spirit here that’s so rich, I think there's no ceiling for what India could do in this space. So, I think it's just amazing. Ashwini, thank you so much. It was wonderful chatting with you and thank you again for joining us today on Tech Unheard and our grand opening in our new office.\nAshwini Vaishnaw [27:14]\nThank you, Rene. Thank you so much for inviting me.\nRene Haas [27:15]\nMy pleasure.\nThanks for listening to this month's episode of Tech Unheard. We'll be back next month for another look behind the boardroom door. To be sure you don't miss new episodes, follow Tech Unheard wherever you get your podcasts. Until then, Tech Unheard is a custom podcast series from Arm and National Public Media. And I'm Arm CEO, Rene Haas. Thanks for listening to Tech Unheard.\nFarnam Jahanian: On Education With and For AI\nIn this President Lecture Series conversation, Farnam Jahanian flips the script and asks host Rene Haas about his path to becoming CEO of Arm, how his time working with Jensen Huang at NVIDIA helped shape his leadership, and the evolving role of AI in our world.\nThe two also discuss the future of education and how universities like Carnegie Mellon can best prepare students for an AI-inclusive tech landscape.\nRene Haas (0:00)\nWelcome to Tech Unheard, the podcast that takes you behind the scenes of the most exciting developments in technology. I’m Rene Haas, your host and CEO of Arm. Today, our podcast sounds a little bit different than usual. Carnegie Mellon University kindly hosted me for a conversation with Farnam Jahanian, the university’s president as part of his President Lecture Series. Farnam Jahanian came to Carnegie Mellon from a background in computer science and engineering, joining the university over a decade ago as the vice president for research. Before his tenure at CMU, Farnam spent time at IBM’s research center and Arbor Networks studying Internet growth and stability. He also led the National Science Foundation’s Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, home to many programs focused on building cyber infrastructure and a computing and information technology workforce. Farnam and I had an excellent conversation and I can’t wait for you to hear it. We actually recorded on the CMU campus in front of a live student audience.\nFarnam Jahanian (1:09)\nWell, Rene, first of all, thank you for joining us. Thanks for being here.\nRH (1:13)\nMy pleasure. No, it's great.\nFJ (1:15)\nReally happy to have you here. Can you talk a little bit about your professional journey, in particular, you had an incredible career being part of a couple of startups. You moved to NVIDIA, and of course, you've had an amazing run also at Arm in various capacities, including serving as CEO. So tell us a little bit about your professional journey, and also, what have you learned during that that's influenced you, particularly your approach to leadership as CEO of Arm.\nRH (1:42)\nOne of my favorite speeches is if you've ever seen a Steve Jobs commencement speech at\nStanford, and he's got this classic line about connecting the dots, and you can only connect the\ndots when you look backwards at your career. I was very fortunate with my first job out of\nschool was at TI in Houston in semiconductors. And back then, TI was the number one company in semiconductors and I was very intrigued in, when I was in university, around computer engineering and computer design, but also felt semiconductors seem like they're the base technology that makes all of this go. So I chose semiconductors, which was very fortunate in hindsight, because now, particularly when you look at what's going on with the CHIPS Act and tariffs and semiconductors now are front and center to everything. So, I think starting there was incredibly fortunate. I can absolutely tell you, in 1984 it was not something I thought was going\nto be a super strategic decision. Houston was also very warm compared to where I went to university, but I will tell you where I failed the IQ test. I had never been anywhere south of Cincinnati, and I remember I took a job trip to Houston in February, it was 72 degrees, no humidity, and if you know what Houston's like, you're gonna see where this is going. And I came back and I told my parents, I said, “Houston's like California. The weather is no humidity, it's blue skies. I'm going to Texas.” And there's no internet, so there's no ChatGPT, there's no fact checking on how stupid the thing that was to say. But I remember getting down there with my mom, and in June of ‘84 and it was 98 degrees, and I thought, “Oh, my God, what have I done?” But that was a great choice in hindsight, because big company, which meant lots of opportunity. I got to work in fabs, I got to work in design, I got to work in product engineering, I got to work with customers. And one piece of advice that I think I would give folks, or what I learned is that experimenting with something new and getting out of your comfort zone and just trying something because you think it's curious, that benefited me. And one of the things that I put a very, very high premium on in terms of people development and people that we hire is curiosity. Because you can teach a lot of things in terms of skills, you can teach a lot of things in terms of how to get things done, but curiosity is that pilot light that keeps you going, and if you’ve got a natural curiosity for doing things, you're gonna go pretty far.\nFJ (04:02)\nSo how did you end up at NVIDIA? And how was that experience?\nRH (04:07)\nYeah, so I had now been doing seven years of startups, none that had gone anywhere. So I I moved to Silicon Valley in the mid 1990s. I wanted to do a startup - didn't really know what a startup even meant, to be quite frank, I just thought it was an interesting thing to go off and try. And I did a couple of them that subsequently had done okay, but in the time that I was doing it, it was a very difficult time. I joined right before the dot-com boom.\nFJ (04:31)\nSo this is in the late ‘90 or early\nRH (04:33)\nLate 1990s, around your Arbor Networks time frame, right? So late 1990s I joined Tensilica, which was a company doing, of all things, semiconductor, microprocessor IP. Again, back on how the dots connect, that's a company I'm leading now. What we were doing was a processor generator, where you could generate a custom CPU, you could add custom instructions. It was a mix of replacement of RTL and code, and the internet's taking off. So as a result, there's tons of companies doing custom chips for packet forwarding, all the things relative to security for the internet. We hit the dot-com spike – doom – and as a result, we had to lay off 40% of our people, we had to cut back revenue. And then I had a chance to do another startup, again, doing 10 Gigabit Ethernet, which, back then sounds like, ‘oh, that's a no brainer’, but the world was not ready to put down infrastructure for 10 Gigabit Ethernet, let alone one gigabit, and we were running out of money. And then, you know, at the time, I thought, “oh my gosh, I've got two small kids. I don't really have a medical plan. I should go join a real company that's got actually a 401k and can pay its employees.” So I got a call out of the random from a recruiter for NVIDIA and I first thought, you know, my background at that point in time had been around chip design, product engineering, microprocessors. I couldn't spell GPU if you gave me the G and the P. And I met with Jensen – NVIDIA was not a very old company at that time, probably 10, 12 years, and by the way, was doing well, but not – nothing close to what they are now. And I remember asking Jensen, I said, “Look, I'll be very honest with you. I can do a lot of things, but I don't know anything about GPUs.” And he looked at me, I remember, I can recollect very well. He said, “We invented the GPU. If you think I need you to help me with a GPU, you must be kidding.” That was my first learning of Jensen, and it holds true. But yeah, I landed there in 2006 and it was a fantastic experience.\nFJ (06:28)\nAnd after a few years at NVIDIA, I think seven years or so, you were recruited to go to Arm.\nRH (06:34)\nYeah, so this is 12 years ago.\nFJ (08:26)\nAbsolutely, it's gone sort of full circle. Now you have a great partnership with NVIDIA.\nRH (08:30)\nWe have a great partnership with NVIDIA. And in fact, one of the big benefits that we got with NVIDIA was all of their accelerators were connecting to an external processor, x86, and for a myriad of reasons, performance, power, efficiency, flexibility, they went to an integrated chip approach. The first one was Grace Hopper, Grace being the Arm CPU, and Hopper being the NVIDIA GPU. And then now with Grace Blackwell, which is all fully integrated. So they're doing things with Arm that they really couldn't do with anyone else. So it's great for us, it's great for them, and they're a fantastic partner.\nFJ (09:06)\nBy the way, for those of you who may not be familiar, go look up Grace Hopper, and you'll see something about the history of computer science and technology.\nRH (09:14)\nAbsolutely.\nFJ (09:16)\nYou're at CMU, so we’ve got to talk about AI. Throughout the history of AI, of course, we've seen periods where AI has gone through a rise and then what people of our generation would refer to as winters of AI. And there have been multiple cycles. Now, over the last several years, of course, with generative AI and a new generation of AI-based systems, it seems different. It seems very different from the AI of the 1970s and 1980s and even the 2000s. What's different about this latest generation of AI-based systems, and what has surprised you about AI today and where it's going potentially?\nRH (10:01)\nOh, boy, that's a fantastic question. This has sort of been the Holy Grail, right, in terms of, can computers think? And then you get into a definition of, “well, what does think mean, right? Is thinking passing the bar exam where there's a known answer, or is thinking invention, creation, developing something that no one has ever developed before?” So we've been in and out of these winters. And I think back to the NVIDIA example. I think you had the perfect intersection of the huge amount of work done, maybe it's the AlexNet moment, the work that Demis and the DeepMind guys had done, combined with a processing tool that is pretty well suited for this kind of problem. Because I can assure you that when we were working on CUDA, thinking about deep neural nets in the early, early days wasn't one of the application areas. But, you know, look at the early days that work was being done – they were using NVIDIA gaming cards. They weren't actually even using anything that was purpose built. So I think it is the intersection, as many times happen with technology, where a lot of work is taking place on the software side, and then a lot of research is being done in areas like Carnegie Mellon and you had an intersection where now the tools are there.\nFJ (11:15)\nThat's right.\nRH (11:16)\nAnd that's where we're at. Intellectually, I always felt like this was going to happen. We would see this kind of work. I just didn't think I would be able to work on it in my lifetime. I didn't think I would be able to be experiencing it. But now it's moving at such a remarkable pace, it's going to be fascinating to see where it really goes and how it really goes. On one hand, I think there's a little bit of sky's the limit in Stargate and the things we're doing are around that. Then there's another part that says, “well, I don't know yet. Are we stochastic parrots with these LLMs, or are they really, really thinking?”\nFJ (11:48)\nYou know, I'm so glad you mentioned the computational resources that were needed to achieve what we're achieving today. You're right that advances in algorithms and LLMs - undeniable in terms of how far we've come over the last couple of decades - but without advances in computational resources and being able to do this, we would have still essentially been looking at AI and not seeing the kind of transformation that we're seeing. So, a follow up to that question, how is Arm meeting this moment? You talked about the challenges, you talked about the speed at which technology is moving, how is Arm meeting this moment?\nRH (12:31)\nSo we're putting a lot of energy, no pun intended, into this. So today we are involved with\nNVIDIA's Grace Blackwell, and most of the work that we do in that is, the GPU handles a lot of\nthe heavy workloads, you obviously need the CPU to do a lot of offload management of the\nsystem, you know, etc, etc. But at the highest level, the good news for Arm is that we're now\ninvolved in the data center. There's a lot of workloads that are being run around AI. They're all\nrunning through Arm. That's great, and we're spending a lot of investment about how to make our CPUs more energy efficient and how to solve that problem in a better way. On the flip side, basically the client-cloud model, which has existed for decades. AI is not a client model today. It's not even close. And history has taught us that ultimately everything on some level of compute, moves from the Cloud to something that's smaller. Doesn't mean that the cloud is replaced, absolutely not, but it means that some level of hybrid computing will take place. So we are spending a lot of time on that, and the reason for that is that you were mentioning earlier about Arm's footprint, 30 billion devices a year, 300 billion devices, etc. etc. But what that means is pretty much every compute device that we have today, whether it's your security camera, your earbuds, your mobile phone, your PC, Arm is inside. We believe that all those devices are going to run AI, obviously, but to what extent will they run the major workload of AI, how much of that can be done locally versus offsetting the cloud? How much of that inference takes place locally versus having to go back to the cloud every time? So we are spending a lot of time on that. By the way, it's a great time to be in technology because it's a very hard problem to solve, right? AI is heavily compute intensive. It's heavily memory bandwidth intensive. It takes a lot of energy, sucks up a lot of power. Those are all things you hate when you're trying to build small devices that have to run off batteries and, oh, by the way, these devices also have to run the operating system that they did in the past. On the flip side, I think there's incredible opportunity for another huge shift in our personal devices. And if you think about your mobile phone today, your mobile phone is a ubiquitous device. The generation can't live without it, but it was only invented in 2008 so it's not that old of a device. It's basically a pull device. You have to go into it to pull information everywhere you can. Your phone is full and littered with apps. Imagine a world that a lot of the things that you need get pushed to you. Now I'm not saying the phone goes away and maybe the form factor doesn't, but there could be other things that supplant that, that AI pushes to. You're on holiday and you're trying to figure out a map and where your dinner reservations are. It just knows, in other words, it knows you're lost, right? It knows you don't know, actually, where the restaurant is. It actually knows you don't know where the tour bus is. And that information whether it's through a wearable, whether it's through something in your ears, gets pushed to you, versus having your head down and having to look at the phone. So I'm hoping that there's a generation of not heads down anymore, where it's a bit of a heads up. And I think that's actually quite possible.\nFJ (15:58)\nAnd honestly, I don't think we're too far from that model that you're describing.\nRH (16:04)\nI don't think we're too far, and my intent is that Arm is the center of it, because we're running those compute workloads already locally. So what we're really looking to put effort and energy into is how to make that happen on the Arm platform.\nFJ (16:18)\nSo this notion of edge computing becomes much more of a reality now, combined with AI, that\nmakes sense. You brought up energy, and I want to just touch on it. You briefly alluded to what\nArm is doing in this context. You actually, you've been quoted saying that companies need to rethink everything to tackle energy efficiency. We all know that energy efficiency, sustainability,\nare topics that you know, the entire industry is concerned about, obviously, not only in terms of\nenergy production, but also the impact potentially on the environment and so on. We have to be cognizant of it. Beyond the specific things that Arm is doing, what are your thoughts about energy efficiency? I mean, these data centers are going to consume more and more energy. We know this. And some data shows that in the United States, from 2% of our electricity quickly, within a few years, about 12% of electricity is going to be going toward these data centers that are powering essentially AI systems. What are your thoughts on it? What words of wisdom do you have about the issue of energy and AI for us?\nRH (17:19)\nYeah, it's a great question, and, on one hand, the industry got a respite, maybe not in a good\nway, from the standpoint of sustainability in that in the previous administration, getting access\nor getting permitting for new data centers was pretty hard, and a lot of companies had edicts\nwhere they were going to be carbon neutral by sometime near the end of the decade, which is\nreally hard to do, by the way. But I think in the long term for the planet, it has to be solved. Ultimately, the rate of growth of these data centers and what's required, it's not sustainable, which again, brings me back to the role I want Arm to play is moving these things to edge devices, where you're not having to run all these giant workloads in the cloud, where you can run things in a more efficient way at the edge.\nFJ (18:09)\nYou know, I think there's no doubt that not only we need to invest, not just in data centers, but\nwe need to invest in the energy infrastructure of the country, the world actually, to be able to sustain it. And then at the same time, lots of research that needs to be done, to look at the potential environmental, climate impact of, and also double down on research that allows us\nto move down the path of decarbonization, move down the path of much, much more efficient\nsystems that we have, not just computational resources from that point of view, but also the\nphysical systems that we have that rely on digital technologies to be much more efficient.\nRH (18:50)\nAnd I think that's a huge opportunity here, at universities, because it’s not the kind of thing corporate is very good at. The corporate world is working on roadmaps. We're working with supply chains. We're working with lots of different people inside the ecosystem. And if you're a young startup company working in these areas, it's hard, because how do you think about the productization opportunities around that? So I think the research done by universities in this space around sustainability and energy efficiency, it's a huge, huge opportunity for it.\nFJ (19:21)\nI am so glad you mentioned that, because here at Carnegie Mellon.\nRH (19:25)\nThat wasn't a setup. That wasn’t a setup.\nFJ (19:26)\nYou knew that was coming. But candidly, I think absolutely, we need to have a very expansive research agenda for energy. I do want to put a plug in about three dozen of my faculty colleagues, right before the summit that we had, got together and in fact, developed a couple of dozen white papers on issues surrounding energy innovation and AI, covering a range of topics, from, for example, how do you cut energy demand? How do you use, essentially, AI to develop more sustainable, more energy efficient systems? To the issue that I mentioned about decarbonization of various industries, from construction to steel to transportation, and also issues surrounding accelerating development of innovative new solutions, including new materials that can be used for batteries and so on. So the range of topics that you can touch, as far as energy is concerned, and AI innovation is almost limitless. I want to go back to innovation and Arm. You know, when technology is moving so fast, when the speed of technology, and we have to admit that, in fact, again, people who are of a generation during the early 2000s, we thought the digital revolution - we thought the internet technology and so on, is moving so fast, how is society going to keep up with it? Well, it turns out today, in fact, we've seen a much higher acceleration of emerging technologies, whether it's quantum, whether it's AI, whether it's wireless technologies. How is Arm prioritizing and managing the trade-off between the speed of innovation, and being there to serve your customers and so on, engineering quality and at the same time, profitability of the business itself. How do you tackle this?\nRH (22:21)\nYeah, that's a topic we talk about a lot inside the company, and we were chatting earlier about\nmy NVIDIA time. I think one of the things that I learned probably most from working with Jensen was speed. And quality, obviously, you don't want to compromise on and ultimately, as CEO of a public company, you are accountable to the shareholders in terms of financials and profitability. But speed makes up for a lot of sins. What do I mean by that? The pace of innovation is so fast\nthat ultimately, mistakes are going to be made relative to the risks you take and how you\nultimately decide what to invest in and what not to invest in. To be able to move very, very\nquickly and decide what your priorities are, but more importantly, when that priority is no\nlonger a priority, is really important. Case in point, we do long range planning. We have three\nyear plans, five-year plans, 10-year plans. We rip them up all the time. All the time. There's no sacred cow relative to, we'll do an annual planning cycle, and two months later, it might be completely changed, because the world has changed. And I am a very big believer of a mix of long range planning, but being able to pivot in the moment. So I've been the CEO for three and a half years, and that was one of the very first things that I talked about when I became CEO, and I had a slide that said, “if things feel comfortable to you, you're not going too fast.” I don't want people to have a sense of comfort in terms of where things are, because once you kind of have a sense of comfort that you're going to speed limit, people will pass you, And 40 years of\ntechnology innovation, and you can look at the great companies that sat on top of the world,\nwhether it's Nokia or Blackberry and some of these companies, and then people say, ‘Well,\nwhat's wrong?’ Kind of got too late to pivot. So back at Arm, that's the highest priority I put. I\ndrive my people a little crazy with it, but that's the priority I put.\nFJ (23:21)\nYou mentioned Jensen a couple of times. In an interview that you did, you referred to Jensen as a mentor, a friend and a former boss. So when you think about your relationship with Jensen, what are some of the lessons that you learned from him during your career, and how has that influenced your leadership style at Arm in particular.\nRH 23:45\nSo for those who have probably watched Jensen's GTC keynotes, they are very long and they are very in depth. He has an incredible command of the technical depth, and knows his subject matter really deeply. And that's what I learned from him in terms of working with him, and that I instill. So here's a story. I had been there maybe three or four months, and he wanted to do a business review of my business. And classic big companies, you want to do a business review. You put together a bunch of slides. Your business analyst puts together a bunch of financials. You have some people helping you with the technical specs and the road map. So you’ve just got a mountain of data that you know, no matter what the CEO asks you, you know he's not gonna stump you and you usually come into the room with three or four of your team members. So he sends the invite, and it's just me, and I'm thinking, “well, wait a minute, why am I the only person in the room?” And I remember checking with his EA and said, “no, Jensen just wants you.” And I remember this so vividly Farnam, when I got up to his office, he said, “why'd you bring your computer?” I just didn't know what to say. He said, “There's a whiteboard there, go describe your business.”\nFJ (24:54)\nWow. And so what did you do?\nRH (24:59)\nThat's a very classic question. Where would you even start? And by the way, that is the mastery of that question, right? “Go describe your business.” And what he wanted to try to understand in first principle is how you think, to teach you to think about what's important. And it's very liberating when you're on a whiteboard with nobody on your team around you, to try to explain to the CEO of the company. And I was running – at that time, I was running a big business for him, and he would say, “you are the CEO of this business. You need to tell me what's important.” And by the way, he did that with everybody. But back to the example of the GTC, and now how I operate, it was “know all the details, be able to talk about your strategy extemporaneously.” And the key thing, this was probably the biggest learning, and he used to say this all the time, and my team, I think, can attest to this: “Your strategy is not what you say. Your strategy is what you do, your actions, how you're actually leading your team, how you're communicating. That is your strategy.” You may say what it is, and you may put a bunch of bullet points together, but if you have to think about conjuring that up, it hasn't come to you naturally. So that was the biggest learning. I do the same thing with my team now too, by the way.\nFJ (26:11)\nI'm going to try this on my leadership team next week. Folks, you know, I know you agree with me that I can sit here and listen to Rene talk about not only his personal and professional journey, but also his perspective about the industry, about Arm and also his leadership philosophy. But I did promise him that we will turn the table, and he can ask me a few questions, and then I have one final question for Rene before we wrap up.\nRH (26:37)\nOne of the things that, and it comes up a lot in terms of when we think about AI, you know, inside the company. And I'll just give an example, that we're starting to use it a lot inside Arm, and we're using it in the GNA functions, finance, we use it in legal, but we're starting to use it inside engineering. And again, Arm's products are basically the building blocks for doing chip design. We don't build the chip, but we basically design the intellectual property. So we create the RTL, we do the verification, we do all the documentation. So we're a virtual chip company, if you will. There's a lot of work involved with that, and the company's about 80-85% engineers. We're now starting to use these tools a lot for work that our graduate, what we call in the UK, graduate students, would have done, stuff that's like year zero through four, and are even to the point where our head of people came to me and said, “Hey, I think we have to probably have a conversation somewhere down the road of, do we hire as many graduate engineers as we have and/or what do we have them do if a lot of the work that they were being trained on is being done by AI?” Which then leads me to, how do universities help us in this? And what are the roles of universities, and what happens with AI in terms of developing our next great engineers?\nFJ (28:04)\nThat's really a great question, and I know that this is something not only CMU is intensely\nfocused on, but I know many academic institutions, particularly research universities, are\nlooking at this issue. If you look at some of the studies that are out there, six in 10 business leaders are saying AI is going to transform their organization within a few years. There’s data that shows that 70% of the skills that are required for average jobs will change within the next five to 10 years, and a shift that's in fact, fueled by AI. So when you step back and think about it, the question is, when a student comes to Carnegie Mellon today, what do we teach them such that they're going to be in their professional lives for another 40, 50 years, maybe even longer, depending how medicine progresses and so on. So the issue becomes, what do we do in the short term and what are we going to do in the long term? In the short term, there's no question that we need to be very intentional about bringing AI, not only teaching AI to computer scientists, as we do now. And by the way, Carnegie Mellon was the first university to have an undergraduate degree in AI in 2018, way ahead of everybody else. But also bringing AI actually to other disciplines, not in terms of teaching how to teach other disciplines, but also integrating AI into other disciplines. For example, our engineering college has developed a bunch of masters programs where AI is brought into civil engineering, chemical engineering, and different disciplines – how AI is, in fact, changing those disciplines. So we're bringing that to bear. And I think in the short term that's extremely important.\nRH (29:56)\nThere's a lot of debate in our world whether, five years from now, 10 years from now, some of\nthe white-collar jobs, will we need as many of them, right? Let's take engineers and scientists,\nputting the professional debate aside. Do you think the enrollment for those curricula at CMU looks the same five years from now? 10 years from now, do you have the same number? Do you have more? Do you have less?\nFJ (30:19)\nThe issue that you're raising is an important one. Would engineers in 10 years, 15 years, have the same set of skills as the engineers do today? I think fundamentally that's going to change. There's no question in my mind that, fundamentally, even the scientific discovery process itself is going to change as a result of advances in technology. So what that really means is we're not just teaching students skills that they need for the next three years, five years, 10 years, but we have to teach them foundations that they're going to be used to learn new things. If you agree with my premise that the half-life of any skill is five years, that means what we really have to teach students is how to learn new things, and constantly to be able to learn new things and embrace, essentially, new technologies, new science, new disciplines and so on. The second point related to that is, we are teaching our students also many of the soft skills. I think what we have embraced at Carnegie Mellon is, while it's important to focus on disciplinary expertise, teaching students what's known as soft skills, which I think really doesn't do justice to it, problem solving, creative thinking, entrepreneurship, communications. These are the skills, when you talk to employers, they will all tell you those are as important as any skills that we teach our students. So that has become very much integrated into our curriculum. It has been very much integrated into our learning experience, not just for scientists and engineers, for students who are studying arts, for students studying social science and humanities, policy and so on. And the final thing that I want to say about all of this is that while students are going through this process, we can't forget that the traditional disciplinary silos you were asking me about would, for example, a civil engineer in 10 years or 15 years need to have the same set of knowledge as civil engineers that has today? I think likely there is some set of knowledge that's foundational that a civil engineer needs to know, or a chemical engineer needs to know, or a chemist needs to know. But what's more important is that many of the problems that we're facing and tackling are interdisciplinary in nature. In other words, not only do you need to have some disciplinary expertise, you need to be able to connect to other disciplines. So, for me, in terms of the future of education is – how do we educate students such that they're going to be very comfortable, not only being comfortable with their disciplinary expertise, but be able to connect with other disciplines, because that's going to be as important as anything else.\nRH (32:52)\nMakes sense. Where I think we are at Arm, I'd be very curious on your viewpoint on this. Back to the graduate example, whereas I don't think we are slowing down hiring engineers. In fact, when I view the way that we could use AI inside our company, it's to develop products faster. It's to take a product today that could take three years to develop. We could, you know, cut that in half to 18 months. The step up would be ideas, and so another way to put this is, I think as long as we have enough ideas, we're going to have a lot of jobs for people. There's no doubt about that. But to what level, how far away do you think we are with today's AI that it can truly think and invent and create?\nFJ (33:37)\nThat is really a question of, what do we mean by creativity? What do we mean by invention?\nBecause there are really different definitions of creativity and invention. Do I expect that our\ncomputer systems, our AI-based systems, are going to mimic human intelligence? I don't think so. See, we don't actually understand what human intelligence is. We actually don't understand what creativity is. So to suggest that somehow we can mimic it, suggests that somehow we have a model of what intelligence is, what creativity is, and we actually don't have a model for it. So I've always believed that these systems, and we've seen this over the last several decades, they will help human beings by augmenting our cognitive and physical capabilities. So we've seen quite a progression, if you notice what happened in automation and manufacturing and so on. We've seen this in physical labor, where technology and automation and AI and robotics has come to bear, such that we're augmenting human physical capabilities, such that a lot of the work that used to be laborious, to be grunt work, is going away, and it's becoming essentially handled by machines. I think the same thing is going to happen – is happening I should say, when it comes to cognitive issues, when it comes to creativity, as we call it creativity. So a lot of stuff that may have been sort of routine is quickly going away. When it comes to doing research, there is no reason to spend so much time to do research if you have an AI-based system that can help you accelerate that research work that you're doing so that you can then pay attention and divide your attention and put it in areas that are much, much more interesting, much, much more fulfilling, and so on. So I'm not one of those people that believes that, oh, jobs are just going away. We do know that some jobs are going to go away. A lot of jobs are going to be transformed, as I mentioned earlier, that we need to be ready for that AI-based economy. But without any doubt, a lot of new kind of skills and jobs are going to be out there that we haven't even dreamt of. So that, I think, is going to be the future of work, if you want to fast forward anywhere between five to 10 years.\nRH (36:02)\nDo you think the question of cognitive intelligence and how we come up with ideas is too complicated a problem for AI to figure out, or why can't AI figure that out?\nFJ (36:12)\nNo, I don't think it's actually, this is what I was getting at, is that, I would be hesitant to say that\nAI-based systems can mimic human intelligence. By the way, there are people who disagree\nwith this. What I was really getting at is that, if we can't model human intelligence, and we can't\nquite model human creativity, it'll be hard to say that we have essentially replicated it. However, the question that you're asking is a fascinating one: can these AI based systems help us come up with new ideas, new concepts, that potentially human beings could come up with, or perhaps human beings cannot come up with? The answer to that is absolutely yes. There's no question in my mind that the entire scientific discovery itself, process, it's being turned upside down as a result of access to AI and as a result of access to technology, and it's going to transform the way we do discovery, it’s going to transform the way we do research. It's going to transform, in fact, even in a way that we take innovations or inventions, from research and prototype, to translation, to actual commercial systems. I think all of that is going to be impacted by AI-based systems, because they're going to help human beings actually do a far better job than we've done. Can we come up with new ideas based on just AI based systems? We're already doing it. I think it's already happening, and we're seeing it, and I believe that is going to be an acceleration of it moving forward.\nRH (37:45)\nDo you see an opportunity, as President of Carnegie Mellon to harness that in any way, to accelerate how you do research and teaching here?\nFJ (37:53)\nAbsolutely, and we're actually doing that today at CMU. Here's the way we were approaching\nactually scientific discovery. We've actually created a lab. It's a wet lab, essentially, an experimental environment, where we're automating, essentially wet lab experiments remotely. So a chemist, a biologist, a material scientist, they can do essentially, should be able to do their\nexperiment remotely by having access to hundreds of essentially potential scientific equipment. Now imagine taking that, Rene, being able to do experiments remotely and augmenting that with machine learning and AI based system such that you can essentially reduce the search space that you're searching for a potential new drug, for a potential essentially new, essentially, discovery, if you're able essentially to bring AI and machine learning and add that with automation and bring all of that together, which is really bringing simulation-based systems, if you will, with physical essentially, manifestation of this, and bringing all that together. I believe we can accelerate scientific discovery. I think we're going to come up with new things that are going to be totally revolutionary that we have not thought of. Of course, this will have impact in life sciences, in medicine, obviously, in other areas, from new materials to new battery systems and energies and so on.\nRH (39:18)\nAmazing, amazing. I think, Farnam, since this is your lecture series, you get the last question.\nFJ (39:24)\nAlright, thank you. What I want to pose to you as our last question is, if you go back a few decades and you put yourself in a position of students, what are one or two pieces of advice do you have?\nRH (39:37)\nI would say, experiment often and be completely comfortable with failing. Mistakes are made,\nwe're human, and Farnam, I'm sure, can speak as well – when you get longer in your career, the mistakes you make are the lessons that you learn, and they move you forward. So I would say, experiment often and be happy with failure, because that will give you the advancement that you're going to really deserve and want.\nFJ (40:01)\nWell with that, please join me in thanking our distinguished speaker today, Rene Haas, CEO\nof Arm.

I'm Rene Haas, your host, and CEO of Arm. Today I'm joined by the legendary musician Peter Gabriel. Listeners will know him for hits like Solsbury Hill and Sledgehammer, as well as his commitment to activism and innovation. Peter has long been an early adopter of new technologies in his music, having been on the front edge of digital recording, download, and distribution tech. He's also used innovative technology and other spheres, including the use of cameras and the internet to mitigate human rights abuses with a charity witness, always pushing the boundaries of technology and creative work. Peter ran a competition with Stability AI a couple of years ago, asking artists to submit AI animated music videos inspired by and set to his music. Peter Gabriel, welcome to Tech Unheard.\nPeter Gabriel (00:59):\nThank you very much.\nRene Haas (01:00):\nIt is a pleasure to have you here. We're actually in the English countryside at the Founders' Forum, which is my first time here, but we were chatting earlier. This is your 15th or 16th time to this event.\nPeter Gabriel (01:12):\nI think I was invited to the second one, and I have no idea why, but I had a good time and I've been enjoying coming ever since.\nRene Haas (01:20):\nFor you personally, what do you get out of coming to something like this?\nPeter Gabriel (01:24):\nWell, my dad was an electrical engineer inventor, so I think that's the starting point from my interest, but it just feels like there's a lot of smart people who are going to influence what happens in the world, and a lot of the stuff they're generating is optimistic and positive. So I come away usually excited by some of the stuff I've learned. So for a curious mind, it's a wonderful place.\nRene Haas (01:51):\nYeah. We'll touch on a few things that we saw because there are actually some very, very fascinating demos here. But you mentioned your dad was an electrical engineer, and that's my background, and my dad was a scientist more into physics and chemistry, an inventor. But I'm curious, your dad being an electrical engineer, what were the kind of problems he worked on?\nPeter Gabriel (02:11):\nWell, I think in the war, he was part of a team that before radar, Germans used to have a beam the planes would travel along, and so they found a way to bend the beam so that the planes ended up dropping the bombs into the ocean rather than on land.\nRene Haas (02:30):\nOh my goodness.\nPeter Gabriel (02:30):\nSo that was a useful thing. And then he got involved with cables, and I think he ran the, well, I know he ran the first experiment running tv, fiber optic cable.\nRene Haas (02:43):\nOh my goodness.\nPeter Gabriel (02:45):\nWhich is actually credited to an American, but his was two years prior to that.\nRene Haas (02:49):\nYou mentioned the beam sort of diversion for German airplanes. Was he working for a defense contractor for the UK government?\nPeter Gabriel (02:58):\nI think it was for the government.\nRene Haas (02:59):\nOh, for the government directly.\nPeter Gabriel (03:00):\nBut his main company was a company called Rediffusion who mainly designed televisions, and then they created a television studio, but he also was involved in aircraft simulators that Disney bought eventually, I think for theme parks.\nRene Haas (03:17):\nYeah. So that was end-quote, real electrical engineering in terms of developing.\nPeter Gabriel (03:23):\nYeah. And he had his workshop where he used to run away from the craziness of the family and make things and fix things. I inherited his skill to sort of disassemble almost anything, fixing and reassembling, I didn't get.\nRene Haas (03:37):\nWell, the road less traveled/forward. My father was a scientist as I said, I had an interest in getting into media and broadcasting and TV and also in engineering, and my dad said, well, if you want to pursue the latter, we'll fund it. If you want to pursue the former, you're on your own, which made the economic decision very simple for me.\nPeter Gabriel (03:57):\nFunny how that works.\nRene Haas (03:58):\nYou didn't follow up your dad relative to the engineering background. You got into music. Why into the creative area of music versus the engineering side?\nPeter Gabriel (04:05):\nI never had his skills. I think I may have been a bit ADHD. I was dismal at exams, so I didn't have the smart enough exam results to get into university, and I was passionate about music, and it felt like all the pent-up emotion and frustration that I had, I could pour into the music and it felt I started off as a drummer so I could hit things.\nRene Haas (04:31):\nWell, it's interesting because - well, a few things. First off, probably if you grew up in this era, being not very good at exams would not have actually been an inhibitor to getting into this field, because clearly there's been a lot of people who have been very successful who weren't great academic and test takers. But on the second hand, and I've noticed this in my engineering career, there are many, many engineers that I've worked with who are musicians and very good ones. And there's something about how music is created that is very analogous in some ways to the way engineering problems are solved. Do you have a view on that?\nPeter Gabriel (05:04):\nI do. I think it's probably something to do with the way the brain is structured because it also, for maths and medicine - I mean, the first band I was a drummer in was not a very good jazz band, but it was all doctors. But I think somehow maybe it's patterns and organization, that some sort of skillset, and - I mean, I hate this division. You know, I think arts and science should be open to everybody, and we should use AI in part to allow us all to become artists and scientists and self-generate these creative worlds around us. So I hate people limiting themselves. I think fear determines many, many human decisions and shouldn't, but we need to pump ourselves up in various ways in order to break through the fear.\nRene Haas (06:01):\nAnd there's a lot. I want to ask you about that in terms of AI and the brain and how we make decisions. But when you got into music, in terms of your creativity, was it something that you would write down what it is exactly you were going to try to compose? Or did the ideas come to you somewhat in an analog or random fashion relative to how you constructed your ultimate output? I'm curious you know, engineers start with a bit of the ‘what problem am I solving’ and work backwards relative to the logic required. In music, when you're creating something for you personally, how does that come about?\nPeter Gabriel (06:36):\nWell, I have a theory that there are two types of creative energy, Energy A, which is more analytical, which may be mostly computer-assisted, and then Energy Z, which is more intuitive and zen energy. And so for me, an ultimate creative structure would be different layers. So perhaps you map a rhythm in layer one and you improvise something, and then you use whatever brain power can assist you to improve it and focus on details. And then the next level might be timbre, next level melody. That's the theory. I mean, often it just happens in a messy random way. And I remember an interesting conversation with George Martin, because he would say, what I do, I have a clear picture and I know how to get there. For me, it's much messier. You know, I throw a lot of shit against the world until something sticks, and I love introducing the random, and I think that's a key part of design is to get a randomizer in there that's really opening things up.\nRene Haas (07:52):\nYeah. And I think when I think about AI and I think about AI relative to our industry, it's much more the George Martin aspect. In other words, it's logical, it's a work back. If you look at the way large language models work today, they work off of a known set of answers and then test and test and test and test until the right input comes back. The zen part that you just created, the throwing shit against the wall, then I wonder whether AI can ever accurately capture, and that gets into really the bioscience of the neurons inside the brain that my brain is 20 watts, your brain is 20 watts. The way your neurons fire to create something is completely unique to you. I could never do it. And I wonder whether you think AI could ever achieve that?\nPeter Gabriel (08:41):\nI'm certain it will. Yeah. No, I really think that, you know when-\nRene Haas (08:45):\nWhy are you so certain?\nPeter Gabriel (08:46):\nWell, I mean, maybe it's just smarter algorithms that are better generating, but I mean, there's a lot of random elements in the world, which could be inspiration if you like, for the algorithms. You know, I can't see any job that in the future can't be better done either with the help of AI- obviously person-to-person skin-to-skin, nursing or whatever else, these are harder things to crack.\nRene Haas (09:15):\nSo you believe that AI will ultimately get pretty good at creativity and invention?\nPeter Gabriel (09:19):\nYeah, I think it's absurd that it wouldn't.\nRene Haas (09:23):\nYeah, there's a lot of healthy debate on that topic, just relative to can AI solve problems? The answer is not known. And I agree with you, I think, and we're already seeing this, right? There's the aspects of artificial intelligence that are either augmenting jobs or accelerating jobs, and with every technological innovation replace some jobs. But the creativity and invention and innovation, which is uniquely human and uniquely patterned to how our brains operate, that to me will be quite a fascinating bridge to cross when we cross it.\nPeter Gabriel (09:56):\nYeah, no, it may take a little while, but I know Bill Joy a little bit, and he's working with his son on a systems-based approach to AI using fractals and patterns and trying to, I guess reverse-engineer, I'll get it wrong if I try and describe it, but it just senses that maybe rather than going from leaf to leaf, it might understand the branches and the trunk and the roots a bit. And if that materializes, maybe that would help in this process. But it then brings up all sorts of societal questions. We tend to go towards the most effective and cheapest solutions to all problems. So where does humanity fit in that? And the universal basic income is one possible solution, but we don't have the resources to jump to that. So I think this is a very interesting and potentially awkward transition that we're making.\nRene Haas (10:54):\nWe're in the midst of some things that - and you and I are roughly the same age - but I did not think that we would see in our lifetime. This is one of these things, I always thought that a few generations would have to worry about this problem, but not ourselves. But now it feels like we're front and center of it, which really raises a lot of fascinating questions, as you said, in terms of moral, social, societal, in terms of where things are going to go with this.\nPeter Gabriel (11:20):\nOne project we were worked hard on was to create a thing called theelders.org. Richard Branson and I went to Mandela and tried to get former world leaders working together so that they would have a currency that wasn't based on economic, political, or military power, but just on moral authority.\nRene Haas (11:43):\nOh my gosh.\nPeter Gabriel (11:44):\nSo that's just one thing, but there's many people working on different projects around the world, and I'm passionate that we need to find a way right now of connecting all the people that have optimism and hope, because, you know, I still believe you can go anywhere in the world and you'll find kindness, compassion, generosity. But we don't have a means of harvesting those. Whereas right now, hatred and division, we can harvest and we can make particular people very powerful through that process. So there needs to be a counter-movement and I think there's a growing group of people looking at ways whether you can create global passports, global citizenry, global commons, all sorts of ideas that I think could bring people in. And then whatever amount of military that gets thrown at this, ideas can't be killed off while there's one person left standing,\nRene Haas (12:42):\nI was not familiar with theelders.org. Is it still - you said Mandela.\nPeter Gabriel (12:46):\nYeah, still going. And again, I think we are looking and hoping that there'll be ways that, I mean, they have successfully influenced quite a few difficult situations, but it was an example.\nRene Haas(13:00):\nInteresting. What are some? I'm just kind of curious.\nPeter Gabriel (13:02):\nWell, I think where there's been war about to break out, I mean a couple of places in Africa and so on, I think they've gone in. Tutu was the chair for a while and Kofi Annan afterwards, and then they've been able to go to Myanmar and Cyprus, places that have tensions still. I mean, Israel Palestine is still - I don’t know how effective they were there, but they certainly let their voices get heard. And the idea was, you know, Mandela was quite clear at the opening, he said, if you can't see and feel this in the village, you're not doing the right thing. They had one program against child marriage, which has changed laws in a number of countries. So there's small incremental things. But if there was a movement which could unite various people working on climate or indigenous rights, land rights, all sorts of things that could get connected.\nRene Haas (14:00):\nAre governments involved in it, or?\nPeter Gabriel (14:02):\nNo, and anyone who's still active in politics is not allowed to be an actor. But the Elders select themselves.\nRene Haas (14:09):\nGotcha. I get there's not a bad thing to kind of have a self-selecting body in terms of that sense.\nPeter Gabriel (14:15):\nYeah, but I mean, but a dream might've been that may still happen eventually, the people of the world try to elect people who they think have made remarkable difference with their lives. And obviously we've had a fair number of Nobel Peace Prize winners in amongst the Elders. So but it's an example of an initiative, which, you know, I'd love to see connected with people at the bottom, so that it's-\nRene Haas (14:41):\nThat's fantastic.\nPeter Gabriel (14:42):\nWell, yeah, but I think there's a lot of people doing things, but we just need to sew it all together.\nRene Haas (14:49):\nYou've been involved in so many interesting, fascinating things. We could spend so much time. I want to go back to the founder’s forum we're at, you and I just walked through the demo tent and we saw something interesting in terms of a regenerative electronic process. We drank some algae together. Good for the gut. I'm not sure, I'm not sure, might be last algae drink for quite a while. You said your dad was actually involved in something kind of interesting, similar in terms of -\nPeter Gabriel (15:15):\nWell, he wasn't involved at all. He was a consumer, and I think mainly he bought sort of plasma-creating electronic device that would, I think he was hoping cure baldness. But it was, I mean, I've looked at, I think it's from the 1950s or ‘40s, but it's got a whole list of therapies, which I'm not sure how many have the evidence behind them, but I'm passionate about energy therapy in the sense that the way pharma is structured at the moment, we are going to serve the wealthy once again, but we're not - maybe certain exceptions - going to reach billions of people around the world. However, and this is where your world comes in, I think if you can get consumer electronics generating infrared healing, ultrasound, better understanding of what's happening with the electricity in the body and magnetic fields response that we can maybe get directly to individual cells and get something that you then connect to your phone and could provide high-tech healthcare to billions of people at an affordable price.\nRene Haas (16:21):\nYeah, you and I were chatting a little bit about this, and I've become familiar recently with energy therapy, and I'm a little bit of an old school guy, just from the standpoint of if it's not covered on their insurance and covered in your med plan, is it a legitimate type of procedure? But people who I know have used it-\nPeter Gabriel (16:40):\nYeah, some very close to you.Rene Haas (16:41):\nSome very close to me, and they swear by it. And it makes a gigantic difference in their lives.\nPeter Gabriel (16:48):\nAnd there's now the evidence there. There is the good science.\nRene Haas (16:51):\nSo what's the blocker behind this?\nPeter Gabriel (16:54):\nWell, I think you need a cultural shift towards healthcare that the old days where you got sick and who do we go to? We go to our parents and say, an expert. We hand over responsibility to someone else, fix us, please. But it doesn't work like that, particularly now, we've got to be collaborators. Both sides asking questions. Not one side who knows and the other who receives.\nRene Haas (17:19):\nIt's an area where Arm technology is such a natural fit. Arm is in a lot of medical devices today, simple devices, home blood pressure monitors and things of that nature. All of that work that's being done is all happening on an Arm-based solution. And we've had a lot of people inside the company for years have been passionate about addressing this field, we've run, we tend to run into a lot of regulatory issues. Just simply for the people who are the device manufacturers commercially, they just look at the amount of time it takes to develop such device and the cost, and they run out of the gumption to continue with it. But it's low hanging fruit, quite frankly.\nPeter Gabriel (17:56):\nAnd it's less regulated than drugs. So that there is a way maybe through consumer electronics of getting some stuff tested that can just be made available. And then the science and clinical trials can take place afterwards as long as people aren't dying in the meantime.\nRene Haas(18:14):\nYeah, and I think back to the drug industry, they've got their own motivations in terms of how pharma is set up. It's a highly regulated industry. It's a very expensive industry. And alternatives are absolutely needed.\nPeter Gabriel (18:26):\nAnd I just think there's so many opportunities and you're beginning to see startups in this area, and there is growing evidence.\nRene Haas (18:33):\nYeah. No, we just ran into a couple interesting ones just in the demo area. Switching gears for a minute, I'm going to talk about Stability AI. Yeah and I read about your interesting work in terms of creativity there around and music and such, or maybe video. Can you tell us a little bit about what that is and how you got involved with it?\nPeter Gabriel (18:49):\nWell, I just think I love any creative tools that suddenly allow ordinary people to do exceptional things. And so AI has definitely given that opportunity both in video imagery and music. Now, I was very happy to just open up my music for people to experiment on. I mean, there are still some ethical issues about training models and all the rest and who it takes from, but - you know -\nRene Haas (19:17):\nWhat does it do exactly?\nPeter Gabriel (19:19):\nWell, no, this was just using prompts to generate, I mean, still it's mainly a technical nerd community doing these things. But we also set up a thing, because at the moment, if a video goes onto YouTube, the musician or the songwriter gets most of the income outside of the tech company, and we felt it should be - if it's a good visual thing. But so we have a site we call 50 50, which we're just experimenting with, which will divide the income, which we feel should be larger to the creative side.\nRene Haas (19:59):\nA bit of a democratization then, if you will.\nPeter Gabriel (20:00):\nYeah, we're trying a little bit, but I just think enthusiasm is what I've always been drawn to. And if people want to try things, and I think music is going that way too with its sort of evolutionary approach to music. So we had a slogan, it's the process, not the product. And that if you can invite people in on the process so that they become co-creators with you and some will bother, and I don't want to bother on a lot of occasions, but when I do, I want to have the chance of getting in there and sort of growing this garden that I can help design.\nRene Haas (20:37):\nNot talking about the music industry too deeply from an economic standpoint, but if you look at where it is today in terms of how people consume music, are we in a good place? Are we in a healthy place relative to both thinking about it as an artist and then also just as how the population consumes music?\nPeter Gabriel (20:56):\nWell, I love the idea that anyone can get anything, and that's brilliant. But it's pushed artists' rights back about 50 years. But we had a competitor to Spotify in the early days, we were quite often early in the field.\nRene Haas (21:12):\nYou were very early.\nPeter Gabriel (21:13):\nYeah, we had a music distribution thing two years before Apple, and we had this somewhat similar thing called WE 7, but they actually did it better. But with this one, we worked out we were paying artists 10 times as much as they were getting from Spotify for per stream. So they're very successful and we sold ours on and not so successful.\nRene Haas (21:37):\nSo OD two, pre iTunes, pre iTunes, post Napster.\nPeter Gabriel (21:42):\nI guess it was - I can't remember. It was around that time. Yeah.\nRene Haas (21:45):\nYeah. That is quite a bit ahead of its time.\nPeter Gabriel (21:49):\nYeah, I think we were but - which was often my dad's problem.\nRene Haas (21:53):\nYeah, I mean, I think the statute of limitations for illegal downloads on Napster has probably passed. Yeah, but I remember when Napster kicked off, it was a little bit like Spotify now in the sense of, 'oh my gosh, everything's available and how fast can you download everything?' And then obviously iTunes put it in a different place. But the industry changed forever in terms of distribution of music.\nPeter Gabriel (22:16):\nWhich is brilliant, and Spotify was very well designed in a way that we weren't, but I think they could afford to be more generous now they've taken dominance.\nRene Haas (22:27):\nYeah, no, I think, like you said, as a consumer of music, and I love music, it is wonderful that you can get everything at any time, anytime that you want. But it feels like all that consumption can't be good for the artists.\nPeter Gabriel (22:39):\nWell, this is a question for you then is: should prompts be transparent?\nRene Haas (22:46):\nYeah.\nPeter Gabriel (22:46):\nYeah. I think if you've got a history that goes with any piece of software of origination and influence, then maybe micropayments. I mean, there's no real excuse why we shouldn't be able to generate micropayments.\nRene Haas (23:01):\nEasily. Right. I mean, selfishly, I must've done a bunch of Spotify hits on games without Frontiers and Sledgehammer and Lamb Lies on Broadway. And I'm thinking somebody should be benefiting from this other than me just sort of slipping it. I hope Peter's getting a little piece of what's going on here.\nPeter Gabriel (23:17):\nYeah, a small piece I'm sure. It's better now, but it's still, I would say it has a long way to go. Old, well-established artists, we've done very well. We were there in the financial heyday of the music business. But for young artists and minority interest artists, this is really critical because live work is very hard to get.\nRene Haas (23:38):\nSo one of the things that we talk about in my industry is what jobs will AI replace? We're already seeing with things like agents and chatbots and things of that nature where white collar jobs can be replaced. And on one level, you look at it and say, what's to worry about here? We've seen that with every technological evolution. There are jobs that go away, and things get more productive. Back to the discussion we had about invention and creativity, we maybe get to a world where music can be generated artificially, and we're kind of there now.\nPeter Gabriel (24:12):\nWe're there.\nRene Haas (24:12):\nBut how do you feel about that, both ethically, technologically, morally, in terms of, is this a bridge too far?\nPeter Gabriel (24:21):\nNo. You can't. You know, it's like King Canute in the waves. You can't stop it. You've just got to work with it and find your corner. So I think that's the only way to compete with AI is to work with it.\nRene Haas (24:33):\nDo you have a viewpoint though? I mean, will you get to a point where there will be music created by AI with unique vocals and unique backgrounds that will say, this sounds pretty darn good. I don't really care whether it was created by a man or machine?\nPeter Gabriel (24:44):\nWell, as a producer always used to say, 'give me a music business without any bloody musicians', because that’s where all the problems come. And we're going that way. There's this wonderful designer called Gaetano Pesce, and he used to say that beauty in the future will lie in the imperfection, and humanity is loaded with imperfection.\nRene Haas (25:07):\nI wonder. It's folks who say, we ended up having a chat with somebody. We had a very, very nice restaurant in New York a couple of days ago, and we were talking about could robots replace the chef? And my patron lunch was saying, there's just no way people will want to know their food has been created by a person. And I said, well, but we don't know who's behind the kitchen. No, the front of the house will always be people, but behind the curtain, the food tastes great. I don't know any difference. And he said, 'No, no, no. People will come to know it's made by humans.' I wonder if the same is through with music. People will say-\nPeter Gabriel (25:42):\nNo, well I think - there is already a robot chef, and I think that it's only going to get increasingly better. And same with music. So I think the fringe is safer than the mainstream because where the mainstream is where the money is, and therefore, that's where AI will first focus.\nRene Haas (26:03):\nAnd I think the other thing it can't replace is obviously live performances.\nPeter Gabriel (26:09):\nThat's a lot harder. But I mean, I went to the ABBA show and you know -\nRene Haas (26:16):\nHumanoids were up there?\nPeter Gabriel (26:17):\nYeah, well, Abba Voyage, it's all sort of virtual characters.\nRene Haas (26:21):\nOh, really? Yeah. I've heard about that. Is that a good show?\nPeter Gabriel (26:24):\nThey do it really well. I mean, I think there’s things for all of us to learn, but it's - as the starting point - they've done it really well. And there is already, you know, Elvis things and Michael Jackson shows coming along so,\nRene Haas (26:37):\nDone - like a virtual?\nPeter Gabriel (26:39):\nYeah, virtually, and that's only going to get better. So, you know I don't think anything is safe from AI. And I think that it amplifies and accelerates everything, and humans are not amplifying and accelerating their reaction and anticipation.\nRene Haas (26:57):\nSo now you've got me very curious. So this ABBA show, it's-\nPeter Gabriel (27:02):\nYeah, you can see it in London.\nRene Haas (27:03):\nYeah. No, I've heard of it, but it's a virtual-\nPeter Gabriel (27:05):\nYeah, it's all virtual. And no, I used to make a joke about it because you know I think they've taken a younger version of themselves. And so I'd said in opposition, I've made my avatar a little fatter, a little balder than the real thing.\nRene Haas (27:25):\nWhen do I see Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins in the mid-1970s? When does that come out? I want to see that.\nPeter Gabriel (27:30):\nYeah. Well, so do I. Because I think all artists want horizontal income, which is where you lie in your bed, and the money comes in.\nRene Haas (27:38):\nGotcha. I will look forward to seeing Genesis perform again in some virtual tour. Peter, it was a pleasure. No, it was a real pleasure. Thank you.\nThanks for listening to this month's episode of Tech Unheard. We'll be back next month for another look behind the boardroom door to be sure you don't miss new episodes. Follow Tech Unheard wherever you get your podcasts. Until then, Tech Unheard is a custom podcast series from Arm and National Public Media. And I'm Arm CEO Rene Haas. Thanks for listening to Tech Unheard.\nMark Chen: On AI’s New Frontiers\nBefore leading research at OpenAI, Mark Chen was a self-proclaimed “late-bloomer” to computer science. He pivoted from an initial career in finance to heading up multimodal and frontiers research at OpenAI, where he led the teams that created DALL-E, developed Codex, and incorporated visual perception into GPT-4.\nMark tells Rene about his roundabout path to AI research and how he integrates research and product development to drive scientific progress and push the frontiers of capability and safety at OpenAI.\nRene Haas [0:07]\nWelcome to Tech Unheard, a podcast that takes you behind the scenes of the most exciting developments in technology. I'm Rene Haas, your host and CEO of Arm. Today, I'm joined by Mark Chen, Chief Research Officer at OpenAI. You might know them as the creators of ChatGPT and DALL-E. Before serving as Chief Research Officer, Mark was the Head of Frontiers Research at OpenAI, focusing on multimodal modeling and reasoning research. Mark has led the teams that created DALL-E, developed codecs, and incorporated visual perception into GPT-4. Now in his current role, Mark's goal is to push the frontier for open AI science and research.\nRene Haas [0:43]\nMark Chen, welcome to Arm. You've come all this way to meet with me. Thank you so much.\nMark Chen[0:47]\nYeah, thank you for having me.\nRene Haas [0:49]\nYeah, no, good to see you in person. You know, they say when you read autobiographies or biographies, you know, start at the beginning, because the beginning will tell you a whole heck of a lot. So maybe just starting with where you grew up, how you got into technology the way that you did.\nMark Chen [1:03]\nAbsolutely. So it's a really hard question to answer. You started with probably the hardest one, but I was born on the East Coast, but my parents were very nomadic, so we moved around a lot. My parents worked at Bell Labs and then they moved over to the West Coast. So I did part of my schooling in the West Coast-\nRene Haas [1:22]\nIn Holmdel, New Jersey?\nMark Chen [1:24]\nThey were in Edison. But in the Holmdel site.\nRene Haas [1:26]\nIn the Holmdel site. Yeah.\nMark Chen [1:27]\nExactly, yeah. So after that, you know, my dad got the startup itch, he moved over to California. We were there for a couple of years and then we went back to Taiwan after that. So that's where I did my high school and part of middle school.\nRene Haas [1:39]\nOh, my gosh.\nMark Chen [1:39]\nYeah.\nRene Haas [1:40]\nHow old were you when you moved?\nMark Chen [1:41]\nI think, uh, probably 12 or 13 years old.\nRene Haas [1:44]\nSo coming from the U.S. public school system, when you got into Taiwan, you're like, Oh, my God.\nMark Chen [1:48]\nYeah, no. It was rebellion for half a year. But I think there is a kind of love where, you know, it starts as hate and you know, after six months, I really love Taiwan. You know, it's just the center of the chip ecosystem. So yeah.\nRene Haas [2:03]\nFor sure. I am quite curious about coming from the- was it a public school or private school in the U.S.?\nMark Chen [2:08]\nIt was a public school.\nRene Haas[2:10]\nSo coming from the U.S. public school system at age 12 or 13 into Taiwan, did you find like, oh, my gosh, I got to catch up?\nMark Chen[2:16]\nWell, it was a little bit of a culture shock, but I already liked math and science a lot. So a lot of it was just, you know, going from more of a kind of a free-spirited teenager to an environment where everyone's wearing uniforms.\nRene Haas[2:29]\nRight.\nMark Chen[2:30]\nYou have fairly strict, uh, kind of teaching style. So that was the big adjustment. But I think it was good to get experience from both of these worlds, right? One where it was more about kind of learning for yourself and another environment where it was about discipline.\nRene Haas[2:45]\nGotcha, gotcha. And then did you do university in Taiwan?\nMark Chen[2:49]\nNo. Then I went back. So I did my college at MIT. There I studied math and computer science as well. But I was a late bloomer to computer science. Yeah. I only really started towards the end - programming towards the end of my college career. One of my roommates kind of goaded me to do it. And I was like, you know, hey, you know, I think I'm going to be a mathematician, but I'll try this thing out. And of course, it's addictive right here for sure.\nRene Haas[3:13]\nYeah, yeah, yeah. So, so math and science were your proclivities, but not so much into computers until you-\nMark Chen[3:20]\nYeah. Not, not into practical programming until later in life.\nRene Haas[3:23]\nYeah. Gotcha, gotcha. And then and then after that, you know, tell us kind of what you did was your first-\nMark Chen[3:28]\nYeah. So my first career was in finance. It really was a little bit of an accident as well. So I thought I was going to go into theoretical computer science and then on a whim, in my senior year of college, I took an internship at Jane Street and it showed me kind of the appeal of working in industry. It's very pragmatic, but you still have a lot of the really exciting problems that you do studying in a more self-contained kind of academic environment. So that was exciting to me. I spent a couple of years at a hedge fund and then a couple of years at a high frequency trading firm as a partner.\nRene Haas[4:06]\nWe talked about this once before, but I think for the listeners it'd be quite interesting because that's not exactly what OpenAI does.\nMark Chen[4:13]\nNo, not at all.\nRene Haas [4:15]\nBut there's a lot of similarities in terms of just the way of thinking from a mathematics perspective, from what goes on with high frequency trading to AI models. What were the things that helped you bridge that from the stuff you had done in the finance world, which you did, what, for five, six years or so-\nMark Chen [4:29]\nAbout five or six years.\nRene Haas [4:30]\nTo OpenAI?\nMark Chen [4:32]\nYeah. So I think the biggest thing is it teaches you rigor and experimentation. So, in the financial markets, there really is no kind of fudging the benchmarks or anything, right? You have a very hard evaluation, which is how much money your models generate. And you really have to be honest, principled, rigorous in your experimentation. I think a lot of that carries over to the science that we did at OpenAI in the early days.\nRene Haas [4:57]\nYeah. Were the traditional AI - traditional is a funny thing to say in such a new industry, but - transformer based models doing the work when you were in the finance world or how would you kind of think about neural networks relative to the thinking world versus the quant slash financial space?\nMark Chen [5:15]\nYeah, so I would model finance as about two years behind the state-of-the-art in AI at any given point in time. So I remember when it was 2017, 2018, the time that I was exiting finance, people there were starting to catch onto neural networks, they were building out their first clusters. And, yeah, I was also looking into kind of neural based modeling in the finance world, as well.\nRene Haas [5:41]\nRight. And just looking now back where so much is happening in terms of obviously in the AI space, we want to talk about, how has the finance world picked up on that from what you've seen?\nMark Chen [5:49]\nYeah, so they're also all in. But I will say one dividing line is you tend to get more AGI true believers on the tech side and people on the finance side today actually are still more AGI skeptical.\nRene Haas [6:04]\nWhen you say AGI skeptical from the finance world. What do you mean?\nMark Chen [6:07]\nRight, I think it's just straight up when you feel like, hey, do you believe that AI will fundamentally transform the shape of the economy in five years? They tend to have a more pessimistic view.\nRene Haas [6:16]\nAnd why do you think that is? It's funny you say that, because I do find that also. Not finance per se, but other industries that I interact with, who have different, either methodologies for scientific research or product development. However they do that, the skepticism bar is a lot higher than I would have intellectually anticipated. But in the finance world, why do you think that is?\nMark Chen [6:40]\nI can only answer for the high frequency trading world where a lot of it is extrinsic to the pure modeling. So, I really do believe that AI can improve the modeling side of things. But there's so much on latency, there's so much about your private sources of data. So, I think there's just so many extrinsic factors of alpha that maybe AI and modeling itself just really isn't a huge part of it yet.\nRene Haas [7:05]\nAs I said, I run into this, you know, in other industries. And some of the things I hear back is, our problem cannot be modeled. The data sets either don't exist and/or the problem is a far more complex model than AI or AGI could ever, ever assist with. You think that applies to the thinking in the high frequency trading world?\nMark Chen [7:23]\nWell, I don't know. We hear this refrain over and over again. I think you have to be in the world to really believe in it. Sometimes you just have to see the tech to start feeling the AGI, as we call it. And I think at OpenAI actually going in, I would say I was somewhat of a skeptic when it came to AGI. I think much of the world was back then and really just seeing the progress of the models seeing the capabilities that really opens your eyes to it.\nRene Haas [7:50]\nYeah. So, the story as to why you joined OpenAI, is a cool one. Why don’t you maybe share that with folks.\nMark Chen [7:56]\nYeah. Well, I think over time it has a lot to do with finance and it also has a little bit to do with AI as well. But, you know, finance, it's, I think, a hard industry for someone who wants to make impact. And what I realized, having been in finance for many years, was that the set of competitors, it's the same. Everyone gets a little bit faster. But at the end of the day, you're still competing against the same people, you're still competing on the same objectives, and extrinsic world doesn't change too much for it. And I felt like, you know, that wasn't a very satisfying way to live out the rest of my life. And it felt like I needed to make some sort of change. At the same time, I saw what happened with AlphaGo, and that was equally inspiring, scary, you know, so many feelings wrapped up in one, and I just felt like I had to really get into that. So, some of the first projects I did were in reinforcement learning, just figuring out how do I train these Deep Q-Networks to play Atari games? And once you start taking on some of these projects, it's very addictive.\nRene Haas [9:02]\nBut OpenAI in 2018 was a very different company, obviously, than they are now. You know, it's much, much, much smaller. Charter was a little bit different, and I think that drew you a little bit, too, to kind of what-\nMark Chen [9:13]\nIt did. Yeah, it did. So I joined a nonprofit at the time, and in some sense you can view that as a reaction away from finance. So, I felt like I was in a very materialistic world and I wanted to do something with impact and I do feel like a lot of early OpenAI had that mindset of we believe in transformative AI, we want to bring it about to the world, we want it to benefit humanity. And that persists to the leadership today.\nRene Haas [9:41]\nAbsolutely. Yeah. It is very clear that Sam is a big believer in that. So, you've been there now seven, eight years. Are you surprised at how far it's come in seven years, or do you look at it and say, you know what? There's so much more to go? I mean, how do you think about the last seven years?\nMark Chen [9:56]\nI think both are simultaneously true. So, I don't think anyone could have predicted this trajectory of AI. All we could do was predict kind of what we call perplexity. So this is the ability for you to model, let’s say, human language or a measure of accuracy and some sense of being able to model human language. And you can predict for a particular scale what kind of accuracy you're going to get. But what you can't predict is the emerging capability that falls out of getting that level of accuracy. So, you know, when we got to GPT-2, it wasn't obvious that, you know, this level of perplexity would mean that you get coherent paragraphs. And then with GPT-3, not clear that that level of perplexity would give you the ability to do in context learning. And then GPT-4, you know, the ability to crush all of these college level exams. So really it's really inspiring to see all of the emerging capabilities that come out of the model.\nRene Haas [10:55]\nOne sense of scaling and wonder how you think about this, how much of the progress or scaling of the capability, as you say, is a function of breakthroughs of the models versus we just have access to far more compute and we can just throw more dollars at it, either whether it's chips or power or whatever it is.\nMark Chen [11:15]\nI think this was studied once and clearly both factors are very important. But I think the algorithmic insights and efficiency improvements have slightly outpaced the compute contributions.\nRene Haas [12:28]\nAnd can you say a bit more about that without giving away, no secret sauce to be given away here but, anything just that would give the indication is where the algorithms have just gotten smarter.\nMark Chen [11:37]\nRight. Right. So I think today, you know, there's a sweeping generalization of, we use transformers to train language models, but transformers themselves have evolved a lot over time, too. And I can talk about some earlier work. You know, we evolved the attention patterns of transformers. So I did some work early on with Ruan at OpenAI about fact-raising attention and that that's an efficiency gain. There are other subtle things too I think where you do normalization in transformers, how you set up the aspect ratios. All of those things are things that you have to figure out and be very careful about.\nRene Haas [12:10]\nIs it transformers till the end of time or do you think we get where there's an S-curve, where transformers run out of runway and there's something next?\nMark Chen [12:18]\nIt may be possible that something takes over, but I think the longer that transformers are here and the longer that they remain dominant, the more we co-design around them. So we will build chips that are efficient there. They become the benchmarks, right. And we will build kernels for them. So it just - the bar keeps getting higher for something to overtake transformers and it's hard to see that-\nRene Haas [12:39]\nAre we there already? Because I do wonder, to your point, the model has been established, hardware architectures, you know, morph to it, scientists know it. And you may have this, this bias that starts to run in to, say, if everything is transformer-based in terms of how I develop the next data sets and models - that's how it's going to get done.\nMark Chen [13:03]\nYeah, I think transformers, they're popular because they're a really good balance of simple and expressive at the same time. So they get all of the mixing primitives that you need a highly expressive mixing primitive, but they're also very simple, which allows you to scale it and engineer it in a very fairly straightforward way without too much gymnastics. So I think it's a very well-suited architecture.\nRene Haas [13:26]\nYeah. I don't know how much you interface with potential clients, but do you hear the safety thing increasing, now, given with the capability of certainly [GPT-]4.5 and [OpenAI] o3?\nMark Chen [13:35]\nYeah, I think so. And you know, today is a world where we're moving towards AI with connectors. So these are AI models that can plug in to your email, your Google Docs, your Slack. And I think that poses real risks. People today are fairly good at jailbreaking models, too, if there's a very motivated hacker. So what is the implication, right? You could imagine that someone motivated extracts all that information away from you or they're able to launch some kind of coordinated attack.\nRene Haas [14:03]\nRight, so then literally at the source code level, you could just simply put things inside the model that when those queries are requested, be rejected.\nMark Chen [14:12]\nRight. Yeah. So I think there's even the possibility you allude to where, if there's a bad faith model developer, they could create a model and bake in certain behaviors into weights where there's some kind of trigger for that happening.\nRene Haas [14:27]\nYeah. No, it's interesting because I remember attending the very first AI Safety Summit which was, gosh, almost two years ago and there was a lot of talk on it then. And maybe it's just the circles I'm moving in, I haven't heard as much on it, even though the models have progressed incredibly since then. So that makes a ton of sense. You've done a lot of work, I know yourself, on multimodal and that's yet another yet extremely cool frontier. Are the architectures today well suited for multimodal in terms of, it's a big data problem, right? The data sets are really gigantic, back to the transformer piece. Just talk a little bit about multimodal and where you think that goes.\nMark Chen [15:09]\nAbsolutely. Yeah. This is a topic near and dear to my heart because one of the first projects I did was trying to apply transformer architectures to multimodal data sets. So one of the big papers that I'm still very proud of today is called Image GPT. And that was a proof of concept that you could do image generation using the same text transformer stack, right? And all you have to do is view images as a language in this very special vocabulary of pixels. And I think at the time, you know, it was, you had different architectures like GANs or VAEs that generated images and used transformers for text. And I think the importance of proving out this approach is it paved the path for something like DALL-E, right? Where when you have image generation, you want it to be steerable image generation. So you want text to be the language by which you specify the image you want. And in that world, if you have a different architecture for text and images, it's just not satisfying, right? You would want to be able to just throw all of your data into the same model and train it to be able to output the image. So since then, we've expanded on that idea and created [OpenAI] 4o and this is a model we launched last year and it really showed the strength of a fully multimodal integrated approach where you just throw audio, images, video, text all at the same model and you can get, you know, really emotive speech. You can get images like the image generation launch that we just did and that was so fun.\nRene Haas [16:42]\nYeah, super, super cool. But it also seemed like it’s - and I guess if you're in the world of selling power or selling data centers or selling chips, a good thing because the data set just explodes in that world.\nMark Chen [16:54]\nRight. Yeah. I think there's so much intelligence locked up in multimodal data and just the ability to expand your data set by orders of magnitude through that and be able to try to figure out how to unlock that is important.\nRene Haas [17:06]\nOne of the things that when I talk to researchers in different fields and different areas back to this problem is too hard for AI/AGI to solve - when you think about real world problems, whether it's around chip design, whether it's around pharmaceutical research, whether it's around drug discovery, link to that. Where are areas that you look at and say these are really, really tough problems, that we're not there yet, but we can get there?\nMark Chen [17:35]\nRight. So I think everything above that you mentioned falls in that class. And to back up there, this is one of the big motivations of us working on reasoning. So our reasoning models today, they give us this hammer where we can take smaller amounts of data and efficiently learn on a smaller amount of data to get the same level of capability. So, many of these verticals, like you mentioned, they're not going to have as much data as the whole Internet. And you need a technique that allows you to productively spend compute, learning all that data. And that's what reasoning gives us. It gives us a tool for doing that. So we're actually very excited for the possibility of models to get very specialized in these areas. We've already seen that with things like math and computer science, right? These models are so good at solving math problems right now and so good at, you know, coding up very difficult algorithms. And I think a lot of these techniques can be adapted to things like drug discovery, like you say.\nRene Haas [18:32]\nRight. Are they good at invention? On one level, they're awfully good at solving problems that are bounded problems,\nMark Chen [18:38]\nYes.\nRene Haas [18:39]\nRight, where the answer is known or there is an answer that you can get to. But what about areas where there isn't an answer today. Invention being a broad term for that.\nMark Chen [18:51]\nSo I have the slightly controversial claim that they're better at invention than we think. And I- the reason I think that is, you know, we've entered these models into some of the hardest algorithms, competitions in the world. And, you know, I have a lot of experience in these competitions. They're often designed to be anti-pattern problems. Basically, what makes a good problem is you can't fit it to a set of known techniques, right? Otherwise, all the contestants are going to know how to solve it. So what we find is oftentimes these models surpass our expectations on these more ad hoc, like, you have to come up with something that really doesn't fit any pattern. And it does really surprise me in some of these problems. It can be very creative and in spots where you don't expect it to be. And I think you do speak to a good gap, though. There is some sense in which they are models which take tasks and then give you responses to tasks. And you would ideally love them to propose tasks and have taste in some sense of this kind of things are hard, you know.\nRene Haas [20:02]\nCan they be solved? And how much of that is we need more data and/or our models in terms of how the human brain invents based upon having either not seen something or been exposed to something?\nMark Chen [20:15]\nRight. Right. And I think today, models probably already do have a sense for what intuitively is, you know, aesthetic to a human, right? And I think you can leverage that to figure out hypotheses that, you know, would be interesting to humans as well. So I think it probably has this latent notion of what innovation looks like, but we should just figure out how to tap into that.\nRene Haas [20:41]\nYeah, it's always a thing I've thought about with AGI, you know, if I make it analogous to a human brain, where the AI today is incredible - given enough data and enough time, it'll figure out any problem. Yet humans aren't always exposed to everything.\nMark Chen [20:53]\nRight.\nRene Haas [20:54]\nYet somehow we figure out paths and ways to learn things, having actually never been exposed to the entire data set. And to me that to some extent everyone's got their own kind of weird definition of AGI. To me that is a bit of AGI, is being able to learn and invent without actually having all the data fed into it.\nMark Chen[21:11] Absolutely. And that's the way we're going, right? It's like we're developing more and more data efficient algorithms where you're learning how to reason and draw insights from less and less data. I think one challenge, though, that I've personally reflected on for a while is how much of invention is interpolation. And I think it's actually a higher fraction than we think, you know, having seen the math world for a while, actually, a lot of very cool results are, you know, you take one person who's a geometer or some person who’s an algebraist and they link together some patterns that they've discovered in their own fields and they bring it together. And I, I think maybe there's a lot less true pure innovation than we think.\nRene Haas [21:59]\nCan AGI replace or augment entrepreneurship?\nMark Chen [22:02]\nGreat question. So I think it accelerates entrepreneurship and- in the sense that I think if we really do coding models right, we create some sort of interface where a human doesn't have to learn how to code, to produce something that they can ship to the world, right. If you can say, hey, I want to build an app that connects writers to drivers, right, that can just get built. You know, the model thinks for a long time it makes it robust and deploys it to the world.\nRene Haas [22:33]\nSo many industries have been washed out by technology advancements. And there's always the doomsayers who say this is going to eliminate jobs, etc., etc., stenographers and typewriter tools, for example, that were that were replaced. Coders are a different species, obviously. Um, and there's one axiom that says the efficiency of these models will generate ability for more coders versus another axiom that says, five years from now, we won't need as many as we've got today. Where do you lie on that?\nMark Chen [23:04]\nYeah, I mean, I just think there's a lot of demand from services that isn't met. And AI will be a point of leverage for people, for professionals especially. They're going to be able to be 2X more productive or 3X more productive now and service that many more people. I think it will drive the costs down, but maybe the demand is there at a lower cost, right. So I think it could be different for different industries, but I do think there's a lot of demand out there given a cheap enough cost.\nRene Haas [23:29]\nThat's kind of what I think, too. I mean, we're in a bubble from the standpoint of where we live physically and the world that revolves around AI that is Silicon Valley. So much of the world yet still has a long way to go to embrace technology, let alone AI. But the speed at which this is moving is just amazing. I mean, just looking at that, just your tools, your deep research tools and reasoning tools, the answers are not they're not textbooks anymore. They’re succinct, you're actually talking to, to a human being.\nMark Chen [24:01]\nYeah, absolutely. I feel like really the bar for deep research is hours of economically useful work. And I think it lives up to that. We've gotten testimonials from people in biology, for instance, who say when it comes to drug discovery, I have a panel of scientists and having them in a room for a couple of hours, they produce similar analysis as the model. So I think it really is exciting that we can do that kind of work.\nRene Haas [24:26]\nIf you think about the next number of years, what are the things that are in the industry's way, not OpenAI’s way, in the industry's way. That said, gosh, if we had more blank - it's not you know, GPU is not a valid answer here - if we had more blank we would be able to go a lot faster.\nMark Chen [24:43]\nHonestly, I think for now we need a lot more researchers and ideas. Right now is such a fruitful time to be doing research. I think we're limited just by the number of ideas we can come up with. Like you said before, if we could get the models to help automate that and help accelerate that, that would be phenomenal. But we need people to come up with ideas, implement ideas. But I do think another big thing is embodiment.\nRene Haas [25:12]\nWhat do you mean by embodiment?\nMark Chen [25:13]\nRight. Right. So we have a product called Operator. And what it does is it's a computer using AGI, meaning it takes as input computer screens and as output emits keyboard strokes or it emits click actions. And you can think of it as it's an interface to your digital work or your digital life, right? And when you think about the future, the extension of that is robotics, right? Like, essentially you're building an AI brain for a robot which can act in the real world. And I think there, you know, you’ll have bottlenecks around how quickly can we make the hardware work?\nRene Haas [25:51]\nDo you think agents become everything over time? And we don't really have apps, we don't really have operating systems in the classic sense today in terms of you have to pull information out from a lot of different sources to get the answers. Do you think we get to a world where it's just an agent that exists somewhere?\nMark Chen [26:10]\nAbsolutely. I would love to have an agent where you just query for all of the information that you need. It should just be behind this layer, right, and you don't have to deal with it. I think Operator really does fulfill that promise if it works. And you ask, hey, you know, what, what is this information? It can check your Gmail and it can operate through any kind of interface you use in a computer.\nRene Haas [26:31]\nAnd does it need to be a computer? In other words, can it be kind of anything moving - one of the movies I love to watch are the Back to the Future movies, which just in one sense, a lot of things are wrong, but a lot of things are rather clever. In Back to the Future 2, there's a scene where Marty McFly comes into his house and as he moves from room to room, the appliances in the room know the context. And they're either making his meal or they're turning on the news, or they're getting his boss on a video Zoom call, which, by the way, a video Zoom call that they were showing in the 1980s. Could you see a world where these agents are suddenly just now intelligent, running kind of everywhere, and back to your point, it's all kind of hidden underneath the hood?\nMark Chen [27:10]\nI think they should be. Yeah. And you can imagine we have a model in the cloud, right? It's your OpenAI agent and all of these things are plugged into it. Right. And so they can understand the context as you go from one place to another.\nRene Haas [27:23] You are, you know, on a personal professional level, working at the hottest company in this space in one of the hottest times in this space. What is it like? Do you pinch yourself saying like, Oh my God, like I can't believe I'm actually in the middle of all this?\nMark Chen[27:35] Yeah, every day. I mean, it's a great privilege to work at OpenAI. You know, I started as a resident, actually at OpenAI. And what that means is someone who wasn't a Ph.D. in the field, right. And I'm grateful Ilya took a bet on me back then and he trained me up in machine learning. And, it's completely unpredictable, you know? And I'm just so grateful.\nRene Haas [27:58] Yeah. No, it's exciting to watch. And, you know, having been around Silicon Valley my whole career and watching these shifts from PCs to Internet to mobile phones, seeing what's going on here is, it's a thrill to be part of. Mark Chen, thank you for schlepping all the way down to San Jose from San Francisco and joining us today. I really enjoyed it.\nMark Chen [28:18]\nAbsolutely. Me, too. Thanks so much for having me.\nRene Haas [28:27]\nThanks for listening to this month's episode of Tech Unheard. We'll be back next month for another look behind the boardroom door. To be sure you don't miss new episodes, follow Tech Unheard wherever you get your podcasts. Until then, Tech Unheard is a custom podcast series from Arm and National Public Media. And I am Arm’s CEO, Rene Haas. Thanks for listening to Tech Unheard.\nAlex Kendall: On Driving Wayve From The Garage Onto City Streets\nWhen CEO Alex Kendall co-founded Wayve in 2017, he was writing his PhD thesis at Cambridge University. From that point on, he’s been in the driver’s seat, as Wayve pioneers a new way to create self-driving cars using end-to-end machine learning.\nAlex tells Rene about Wayve’s embodied AI and about the challenges of growing a company from a garage in Cambridge to offices around the world with hundreds of employees, all while navigating a global pandemic.\nTo learn more about Wayve, its ongoing work, and the technology partnership with Arm, keep an eye out for an upcoming conversation with VP of Software Silvius Rus on the Arm Viewpoints podcast.\nRene Haas (00:07.298)\nWelcome to Tech Unheard, the podcast that takes you behind the scenes of the most exciting developments in technology.\nI'm Rene Haas, your host and CEO of Arm. Today, I'm joined by Alex Kendall, co-founder and CEO of Wayve. Wayve develops embodied AI for autonomous driving, and Alex has been in the driver's seat there since its beginnings at Cambridge University in 2017. All right, Alex, welcome.\nAlex Kendall\nAwesome, let's do this.\nRene Haas\nSo the story I tell a lot of people, the first time I had a demo of your technology was from Stansted Airport into central London. It was December in the UK, rainy, cold, not easy to see, two hours-ish, and we drove all the way in. It was assisted, but the technology was so amazing. I remember Masa was in the car with us, and it was so smooth that he fell asleep, which was quite a testament. But where has your technology come since that day? I think that was the end of 2023, maybe, maybe a year and a half ago.\nAlex Kendall\nYeah, it was. I take that as a compliment that our AI could drive so smoothly that it's smooth enough for you to relax and even doze off for bit of the drive. So full compliment. So the approach that we've taken for autonomy is one where we treat this as an AI problem. Fundamentally, it's a really high dimensional decision-making problem, dealing with uncertainty, different signals, and having to put out a decision to drive a car in a way that has incredible generalization because the diversity of things you see when you drive on the road or in fact for any form of robotics is enormous. So eight years ago, we started off with the approach of end-to-end deep learning for driving and started off in a modest way with various different techniques of reinforcement learning and some Sim2Real approaches to learn everything from initial lane keeping to traffic lights, to roundabouts. But today, as I was mentioning, the strength of this foundation model is its ability to drive all around the world in many different types of vehicles with different sensor sets for different manufacturers and our ambition is to really see this launched as an embodied AI platform across a wide variety of different robots and work with the very best manufacturers and fleet operators.\nRene Haas\nDefinitely want to start with your upbringing and background, but I want to dig a little deeper in what you just said. In 2017, not obvious that using deep learning for automobiles or autonomous was an answer. What was behind your thinking that, yeah, this is going to be a great application for autonomous driving or anything autonomous?\nAlex Kendall (02:36.032)\nHa ha.\nAlex Kendall (04:58)\nBoth our company started in Cambridge. It was bit of Cambridge magic, but more seriously, I spent so much time when I was growing up building intelligent machines, playing with robots and just seeing how brittle and frustrating it is to build robots in a way that's the tang coded where you build the infrastructure rather than the intelligence. And that coupled with some years doing a PhD and surrounded by amazing opportunity to take a step back and look at where things were going. It was just very clear that end-to-end deep learning was slowly gobbling up the robotics stack through perception. And my PhD was able to do some of the early work that showed how to build different perception problems, figuring out where you are, what's around you, what's going to happen next with end-to-end learning. And it was clear that that was just going to keep going all the way through to control of the vehicle. And then when you think about what the future of robotics should look like, I don't imagine a car that's driving in a preset geo-fenced area following a map with a set of hand-coded rules. I imagine the future of robotics as intelligent machines we can trust to delegate tasks to them in a way that they can coexist in society, they can act and interact really broadly. And so for me, the way to build that is to actually develop a level of intelligence that can make its own decisions and operate safely within the environments that we live in. So it’s that belief coupled with a couple of like technical, you know, let's call them first steps that, that gave me the, the, the confidence to go, okay, let's go. We can go build this.\nRene Haas\nSo in 2017, what were the technological limiters relative to implementation? In the AI world, eight years ago is like 100 years ago. But if you go back to when you of conceived all this, what were the big technical barriers in terms of either compute capability and or sophistication of the models? Where were the big hurdles to climb?\nAlex Kendall (04:29.144)\nI think it's so important to work on things that aren't possible today, but are going to become possible and getting that strategy right on what's going to become possible at the right time. There's, of course, lots of aspects of luck at this, but also being prepared to take those opportunities when they become possible. And look, we've just seen DeepMind build the amazing AlphaGo, where there are more stakes in the game ago than there are atoms in the universe. There's an enormously large problem that was able to be solved through very efficient data sampling of the self-play algorithm. So there was that, but of course the game of Go is a very low dimensional space. It's a small checkers board, right? Whereas you think about driving, typical car might have, I don't know, anywhere from seven to 12 cameras, might have five radars around it. That dimensionality, you've got tens of millions of megapixels coming into the AI system. And so the dimensionality is enormous.\nSome of the things that were really challenging then was how do you compress that information, understand it? Even how do you aggregate that amount of data? If you think about what's making self-driving possible, there's a ton of work that's gone on the hardware platform, the supply chain, access to data, and even more importantly, the off-board work and the data centers and the compute that actually allows you to train these kinds of models. And people often say that a system like GPT-4 was trained on maybe about a petabyte of data, but when we think about problems in robotics, I mean, today we're aggregating a data set that's over 100 petabytes. And so it's, it's really in another scale.\nSo my Dad had this, it’s funny, he wanted me to have that education and really be around sort of elite people in STEM, but he also wanted me to remain very Senegalese and so family, friends. So every vacation I did Air Africa, Air France, Paris, Dakar for maybe a week, a couple weeks, and that’s how I sort of stayed in touch with my original country and do to this day, this summer will be Dakar and London.\nRene Haas\nWhen you say 100 petabytes that is on when you make that comment relative to robotics. 100 petabytes represents what in that world?\nAlex Kendall (06:09.762)\nYeah, it's bringing together really diverse sources of data to be able to train this model because we want to make it so our AI can understand what various sensor sets can see. So we have everything from dash cams to surround camera, camera radar, camera radar, lidar data, or even internet scale text and video. And so it's all of that kind of diverse data. But of course, the multi-sensor data sets, camera, radar, lidar, of course, dominate in their size compared to the highly compressed dash cams.\nRene Haas\nWell, one thing that I was struck by when we made that ride was not only the smoothness of the drive and how well it worked, particularly in central London, but there were not a lot of sensors and cameras on that car. You know, relative to what you see in the conventional AV1.0 with LiDAR and whatnot, I remember you telling me that you were not only achieving this kind of breakthrough using AV2.0, but with less sensors than a conventional LiDAR model or AV1.0. Talk to me about that a little bit and how that all comes together.\nAlex Kendall\nYes, there's a couple of underlying principles that make our strategy possible. We talked about the first one, which is that taking an end-to-end learning approach, doing away with high definition maps, but taking an end-to-end learning approach. The second part of this is being flexible and agnostic to the hardware stack. More importantly, working with a lean stack that can be mass manufactured. So not the kind of hardware stack that you might retrofit at a small volume. But if you look at many of the today high-end vehicles, and in a couple of years, what will be mass market vehicles manufactured in tens of millions of unit volume a year.\nThese are vehicles that have hundreds of tops of GPU compute on them. They have surround cameras, surround radar. Some of them have a forward facing LiDAR, but working with a hardware stack that, you know, isn't like the robotaxis you see driving around Shanghai or San Francisco, but is like the vehicles that you see driving on the roads around the world. Those, that's the kind of hardware that we'd love to work with.\nAlex Kendall (08:07.606)\nAnd the benefit of that is that it enables you to bring this technology worldwide to really generalize it, to use cases that will eventually even go beyond passenger cars.\nRene Haas\nBut as to compute, know, so back to the conventional stack that exists inside of an unquote standard vehicle versus these look like spaceships, respectfully, kind of running around San Francisco. If you had more compute, is there something you look at and say, here's the minimum viable product in terms of this amount of compute I need the conventional vehicle versus if I had two or three times that number, call it 100 TOPs or 200 TOPs to baseline. Do you look at and say, I need that baseline and or gosh, if we had two or three X of that number?\nThe sky's the limit.\nAlex Kendall\nYeah, I think onboard compute is certainly one of the limiting and boundary factors for what we're building or for any robotic system. So where we're at today, yeah, call it a 200-TOPs baseline. think this is certainly enough to get a really compelling hands-off driver assistance system that can drive globally in all kinds of scenarios. I think the jury's still out whether that kind of compute can get you to a general purpose eyes-off system in the near term. think there are certainly, it's amazing, like there are optimizations and approaches that just shave a factor of two or three off inference efficiency that can really be game changing or make or break for the system. But certainly, I think we can build such a system with some of the next generation chips that are going to be hundreds of TOPs, maybe a thousand TOPs. But there are a lot of, I think, very compelling reasons why we'll be able to compress these models down. Certainly if you narrow them to something like highway only or something like that, then you can achieve the level of safety on that sort of limited compute.\nAlex Kendall (09:43.266)\nWhen we think about AI scaling curves, which one of the most clear things for us is that they apply in robotics, just like we've seen them play out in large language models. In robotics, though, you don't just have pure AI scaling. You have system limitation issues. And inference compute's a clear one. Camera resolution or sensor fidelity's another one. And so you've got this dual battlefront where you've got to push AI scaling in terms of data and compute, but also work through systems issues, like empowering you with better and better actuation and vision.\nRene Haas\nIn autonomous is the limit for eyes off compute or sensor fidelity or combination of both.\nAlex Kendall\nToday it's intelligence. the vehicles that we're seeing that are coming into mass production, I think it's advantageous to have redundant sensing. So camera radar, for example, and the kind of sensor sets that we have right now. For example, if you were sitting with all the windows blacked out in the car and you only saw visualizations of the sensors that the car could see, you could drive at a level five or a general-purpose level.\nIt is possible for you to drive with those sensors with our human intelligence. We just need to be able to build the embodied intelligence to be able to do that. So I don't see a fundamental sensor limitation here today with where mass manufacturing is going. It's really, we've got to develop the AI and that's what I think we're on the cusp of launching.\nRene Haas\nSo, without giving away the secret sauce, tell us a little bit about how you develop the models. In other words, how you put out fleet vehicles, capture data, end quote, feed it into the model, and the model delivers some output relative to essentially assisted driving. So call it AV2.0 for dummies, if you will, in terms of how that all works.\nAlex Kendall (11:22.552)\nYeah, it's a little bit like a striker in a football team. You know, the policy learning algorithms of actually how do you train the models gets all the intention, but actually is probably less than 1% of the work. 99% of the work is of course, all of the infrastructure to really make the iteration speed on these systems faster to develop. And then more importantly, how do you evaluate them? I think we're seeing this across all forms of AI, that actually evaluating and understanding and proving levels of safety in self-driving or more generally, understanding AI's performance is one of the harder challenges. But for the specific algorithms, I mean, it's a really powerful recipe of training a general-purpose foundation model that learns to understand many different physical tasks and many different physical domains. And then it's increasingly training and optimizing it for a specific deployment context, the specific SoC we're implementing into sensor architecture and the behavior that that manufacturer or fleet is after on their vehicles.\nAlex Kendall\nBoth. So of course the classical machine learning answer is, okay, we collect a bunch of examples of that and go and train against it and shift and bias the behavior to resolve whatever behavior you're trying to do. Of course, there are many scenarios in driving that are either too rare or too unsafe to collect in the real world. And so we want to do that in simulation. I think one of the misunderstood things about synthetic data is that it replaces real world data. And I really don't see that being the case. I think if you have you know, more simplistic environments, then sure, you can hand code a simulator that can replace real data. But for robotics, the sheer scale and diversity that we operate in means that the very best simulators, and look, we put out one called Gaia, a generative world model, they're actually end-to-end data driven in themselves. Now the advantage is that they can learn to recombine data in new ways, and more I view them as giving you leverage on real world data rather than replacing it, because they need to be trained from the real-world data distribution.\nBut they can recombine and give you new experience of that data in a way that can help drive new reasoning and knowledge.\nRene Haas\nAgain, I tell the story many times of the Masa falling asleep in central London. But also my takeaway from that more than anything else was AV 2.0 is going to replace the current models. This is the future. And that's what I was thinking at that time. And if you look a year and a half later, there still are these kind of large vehicles running around with 1.0 systems. What's it going to take for 2.0 to just wipe the 1.0 stuff off the face of the earth? Is it just time?\nAlex Kendall\nTime's certainly going to help. I mean, it's been really interesting to see the just seismic shift in the industry over the last year. Eight years ago when we started working on this, this was like deeply contrarian and dismissed by almost everyone in the industry. Some of the proof points we've had coupled with, of course, just the sheer broad breakthroughs that the AI field has had. And I have really materially shifted this in the last couple of years. And even to the point where two years ago, I couldn't even get conversation with most automotive manufacturers to now that we've got the CEOs of these companies stepping out of our car and those that haven't fallen asleep with comfort going, wow, I want that in my product yesterday. And now it's a case of, okay, how do we engineer this into these products? How do we go and validate the levels of safety that are required? I think we're going to very quickly see, at scale, hands-off point-to-point driving. I mean, we're seeing some products out there now and what our solution will do is enable many different automakers to launch that kind of capability. But the real inflection point in safety and value comes when you make it eyes off. so I think collectively we're in a huge challenge and I wouldn't necessarily call it a race. I'd call it yeah, mean, ambition to bring that product together.\nRene Haas\nGoing back to when you started the company. What was the vision for starting Wayve? What was your purpose?\nAlex Kendall\nI mean, our mission statement is about reimagining mobility with embodied intelligence. And so it's all about building AI systems that enable us to have autonomous machines. Now, when you look at all the different forms of autonomy from healthcare, manufacturing, domestic robotics, I think what was very clear to me was that in automotive and in autonomous vehicles, this would happen far beyond these other spaces because there are so many more factors and conditions that are mature there. There's global supply chain, there's the availability of data, there's a compelling business case, there's proactive regulation in place. All of these aspects are still very nascent in these other spaces. So I have no doubt that they will all become huge game-changing opportunities as well. And I would love to see our AI generalize into them as well. But it was clear that starting in autonomous vehicles was the place to start.\nRene Haas\nDid you start it when you finished your PhD work? Where were you when you started it?\nAlex Kendall(16:36.17)\nI was simultaneously writing up my PhD thesis and raising a seed round of funding\nRene Haas\nThat's courageous.\nAlex Kendall\nand trying to find some local lab mates to join me on this wild journey and turn down their seven figure big tech offers and build a prototype in the garage there with me. it was a pretty fun couple of months.\nRene Haas (16:57.28)\nAnd why did you not take the seven figure big company offer versus rubbing two sticks together on your own in a small little barn house in Cambridge? I always find when I'm speaking to founders like yourself who have been unbelievably successful, that the courage it takes to sort of start that kind of thing when you kind of know the opportunity is big, but you've got behemoths with lots of capital and lots of people competing against it. What was the fork in the road that had you choose to found a company?\nAlex Kendall\nYeah, was a very, very bizarre time. You can imagine coming out of a $10,000 a year PhD stipend. We also, not only that, had offers from a couple of big companies to buy out the technology we're working on. I think it was really interesting, actually. Some of those companies that wanted to buy out the technology wanted to use it to drive perception or data labeling systems. Even there, I was just very skeptical because, of course, the point of a computer vision system is to make decisions. And why stop there? I think, you know, it was very, very clear you needed to go to end-to-end learning for control, but it really just came down to my core values. driven by learning and adventure, and I'd almost reached some of the limits of what was possible in the academic setting I was in, in terms of needing to build a team and had the amazing opportunity to come to Silicon Valley and spend some months with a robotic startup there, Skydio, that was doing incredible work, but learn what it was like to be part of a venture-backed mission-driven team.\nRene Haas\nWere you advising them or what was the role that you were?\nAlex Kendall (11:59)\nYeah, was an intern. I implemented the very first deep learning system for them. Gotcha. I got the drone to go from following people wearing a blue t-shirt to just following people in general, and a very small part of what is an incredible company today. But I guess that exposure opened my eyes to, what's possible with venture capital? Yeah. But moreover, it was a means to fuel the passion that I had, which was building this technology.\nRene Haas (18:50.072)\nSo you went from an intern while you were obviously getting your postgraduate work, but now you're the CEO of a tech company, but you haven't had years and years of management training and such and whatnot. What were some of the things that you've learned about yourself and learned about building a company in those early days? I think folks would love to hear the story about what you learned as a founder.\nAlex Kendall (12:29)\nEvery moment you have is, it's interesting how it can just be an opportunity for learning. Cause one of the interesting things I observed was, look, there's, there's PhDs and there's PhDs. It's very, very different experiences you can have. But some of the things I remember, you know, going through that experience was, I believe you have to let your results do the talking and first have something of substance. But if you are fortunate enough to have something of substance, how to communicate it, how to talk about it, how to give speeches and tell a narrative that can drive further progress was just such an important skill. I turn up to conferences and share work where five different people would have done that work and those that could communicate it, was a real advantage. I remember even just the importance of being able to describe and share a narrative that connects people and aligns them around a vision. But then even just in the early days hacking and building together these prototypes, particularly when there's nothing that can path find for you. There's no existence proof that it's possible. How exciting I found that was, and how every little breakthrough you make, just how much energy it gives you and then how every setback would just also just drive so much determination to go solve it. But I remember the day that we had the very first reinforcement learning system that could learn to actually lane follow and drive down the road. And I remember going out, we were so frustrated after weeks and weeks of work that one weekend I just went in to the house, got the car, went to the test site myself and just, you know, thrashed it out to the point where it worked. And I remember coming back to the team with that result and the delight and moreover how limited it was and how much more there was to do was a really magic moment.\nRene Haas (20:51.448)\nYou also did something pretty tough in that you started a company 2017, doing very physical things, obviously, in terms of autonomous. It's not obvious in 2017 how this is going to be used. Pandemic hits in 2020. Did COVID, was that a setback for you guys in terms of your development? Or how was that period like for Wayve?\nAlex Kendall\nThat was, it was interesting how much we problem solved to work through that. For example, bringing cars to people's houses so they could test in the local area around the block where they were and still actually get time driving, sitting in the car and actually feeling the system drive. But then also, man, it was a tough time personally, cause I was, I was back in New Zealand for a lot of it back home.\nRene Haas\nMy gosh.\nAlex Kendall\nAnd, of course the time zone difference between we were largely a UK company there, but, the time zone differences exactly 12 hours between London and New Zealand. So I was waking up at midnight, working till midday ish and, think getting, getting some sleep and I was back there for some personal reasons, but yeah, that was, that was a rough nine months.\nRene Haas\nDid it slow you guys down in terms of if you look back and say, gosh, if we didn't have the pandemic, i.e. access to roads, butts in seats, or you guys just muscled through it?\nAlex Kendall\nWe muscled through it, but counterfactual if the pandemic wasn't there, I'm sure it did have a slowdown effect. I think when you're building any kind of robotic system, being there physically, being able to experience and brainstorm and whiteboard is just so important. So finding ways to do that virtually required some creativity. But of course, I think we saw this effect that it did bring teams together.\nRene Haas\nSo you guys have about 500 folks, right? 550. And I've worked in small companies where when we got to 180 or so, that was a bit of a tipping point relative to everybody knows everybody and they know what people are doing. For you guys, how's it been scaling to that number and has it felt different as you know, or at this size and growing?\nAlex Kendall (14:58)\nYeah. And even, you know, we've, as a team, we've just gone through, I think another one of those inflection points. It's just amazing to me how, I spend so much of my time designing the, and thinking about the machine of how to operate such a team. And I think that's the most complex thing about building the company more so than the technical strategy. But as soon as you get good at that process, you outgrow it. And it's just been my repeated experience growing to where you are today, but this latest one that we've gone through is taking us from more of a centralized roadmap to one where it's empowered teams that have all the cross-functional skills to go execute against an outcome with the right communication structures to keep them all aligned because building this kind of product requires so many different areas to come together, but we've just gone through a change where we've tried to reduce some of the coupling and empower our teams to move faster.\nOf course, collaboration does come at the expense of bandwidth and it's important to make room for that, but to make room for it in a deliberate way where it's needed. And you see many of those differences from when we were a 50 person team and everyone knew everything to even now getting comfortable with not knowing everything. I certainly don't have the visibility we had when we were 50 people or even 20 people. And so being able to grow and empower structures to run where you're deliberate about where you collaborate and where you trust and empower has been one of the biggest things I've seen here.\nRene Haas (24:16.27)\nHow does feel for you personally? I mean, there's so much written about, you know, end quote founder mode, and leaders need to be in the details. And I know at my company, 8,000 people, obviously I'm not in every detail, but I like to be in the details around the stuff that I think is utterly critical to the success of the company. For you, I mean, you're managing an incredibly complex product and roadmap, technically. How much are you in the details?How does feel for you personally? I mean, there's so much written about, you know, end quote founder mode, and leaders need to be in the details. And I know at my company, 8,000 people, obviously I'm not in every detail, but I like to be in the details around the stuff that I think is utterly critical to the success of the company. For you, I mean, you're managing an incredibly complex product and roadmap, technically. How much are you in the details?\nAlex Kendall\nI think highly and I think I pride myself that although I took one of our friends, Jan Lacoon for a demo drive the other day and he continued to debate with me really, really deep down into algorithmic details and I was embarrassed that it got to a point where I couldn't go any deeper, which would not have been me a couple of years ago. But in general, no, I think I'm an exceptionally detailed orientated person and actually have had to, to coach myself to try and step out and empower a team in many ways. But I think one of the things that I do spend a lot of time on is trying to fly at a lot of different levels, to be able to make sure that there is a quick, line of communication throughout the company. But then, you know, when it comes to actually, aggregating a lot of that signal and, figuring out where there is red tape or problems to be cut or changed to do so in a way that empowers people to drive and those outcomes.\nRene Haas\nOne analogy I've always heard, which I like for CEOs, is that you need to behave like a helicopter. In other words, be able to see above everything, but at a moment's notice, dive down to three inches above the problem.\nAlex Kendall (25:49.002)\nBut I mean, you guys have gone through an amazing last year as well. What's, what's been the biggest, biggest thing for you that you've felt?\nRene Haas\nYou're turning into interviewer mode here.\nAlex Kendall\nWhy not? Got take the chance.\nRene Haas (16:19)\nI think scaling a company through transformation is a big challenge. We're going through a lot of changes in terms of moving to more of a platform-based approach, which ends up being a more complex solution. And as a result, you're going to be bringing in new muscles into the company that you haven't brought in. At the same time, you go through change. And thankfully or unthankfully, depending how you look at it, many companies go through change during a time of crisis. In other words, their business is in peril and it's either change or die, which can accelerate people's acceptance of change. We've been doing very well. Arm’s had a great history. The last number years have been terrific. So when you're trying to instill that level of change in the midst of a successful business model, that can be a challenge from a leadership standpoint. But that's probably the single biggest one. It's a great time as we're chatting about this technology.\nIf you're on the cutting edge of more and more compute and complex technology and complex algorithms, what more to ask for. You mentioned Jan, who is a great guy. I love talking to him as well. And now you've sparked something in your comment that I'd be curious to get your viewpoint on. He's been very vocal, and I've chatted with him also about this, that the work that people should be spending on vis-a-vis LLMs, cetera, is not how to make the LLMs more interesting, but what's beyond them, right? What's kind of beyond the transformer-based model from an algorithmic standpoint, and there's no way I'll go anywhere close to as deep as you guys can do. When you think about that, what is kind of beyond that? Because right now, in a good way, in terms of more and more compute, people are just adding more and more gigawatts, more and more data centers. The more pounding they can do on the problem, the more reinforcement learning, the more compute, the better it is. But is there a next level paradigm shift relative to, from an algorithmic standpoint, that says, hey, when we get to this threshold, everything is different?\nAlex Kendall\nYeah, I think there is absolutely a cascading set of S curves of new approaches to bring in. It's been really interesting to see, I mean, broadly speaking, think it'd be fair to comment in the large language model and cognitive AI space that shift from being a science and engineering problem more to a product problem of how do you exploit new data sets and integrate into different product workflows. But one of the interesting things in embodied AI is, is yeah, we absolutely are seeing that new ideas are needed because there's still that big safety bar.\nYou need to get and not only get, but measure in a way that has quite, quite unbounded and the domain that you can drive in. So I share a lot of Jan's views that I think absolutely for this next S curve, this next, next jump, we're going to need to find new methods that look, there's a lot of detailed work that goes into whether you're going from, you know, whatever flavor of learning structure from convolution nets to transformers, to RNNs, LSTMs, all the, all the different, you know, architectural structures that will continue to make incremental gains. But the representation learning methods for me are the ones that are really driving more general-purpose understanding and in particular how we can get more effective learning signals out. Cause I think if you can predict and understand a scene, then actually acting and engaging within it should be, should be very efficient.\nRene Haas\nAnyway, as we wrap up, it's been fascinating, Alex, and what you guys have done has just been amazing. You're a New Zealander, I'm an American, but we're both running Brit-based companies. You've had a lot of help from the UK government in terms of just clearing regulatory hurdles in terms of getting your stuff on the road. How do governments need to continue to help in this? Are governments a regulatory, one of the bigger hurdles to get through? When you think about kind of eyes off driving?\nAlex Kendall (29:36.268)\nLook, I think there's a lot of misunderstanding with regulation because I actually feel very optimistic about it in autonomous driving. And in general, think there is a hard question about general purpose AI regulation. But when you think about specific AI applications, whether it's medicine or education or specifically for driving, there is a fantastic set of regulation as well as understanding of the risks and the opportunities in that space. So I think actually in autonomous driving, you know, we are today seeing very proactive regulation, even though the technology is not widespread. We helped the UK government write into law last year, the automated vehicles act 2024, which legalizes autonomous driving. We work a lot at the UN-level to drive global harmonized legislation. And I know the US is starting to do a lot more there too. So in general, I think for applications like autonomous driving, we're actually in quite a healthy spot. And yes, we need to do more.\nWe need to implement it more quickly, but I think progress is compelling. And for me, it's an important problem, but the long pole of seeing this technology launch to scale still remains the intelligence, the AI, the science.\nRene Haas\nSo last point, plug for the audience. what countries can we find Wayve technology these days?\nAlex Kendall (31:17.464)\nRene, we're all around the world now. We're in the UK. We've got a fleet, some of our cars being tested in Germany, the US and Japan now. We do road trips all around Europe. We were in Italy last week. We were in Canada a few weeks ago, but that's just our dev fleet at very small scale. What I'm excited for is to see this launched into mass market, consumer and commercial vehicles around the world. And we're working with a number of automakers and fleets to make this possible.\nTwo were publicly announced, namely Nissan and Uber. We're incredibly excited about. hopefully in a car that maybe you own in a couple of years, or maybe you’ll be driving and that'll be there soon.\nRene Haas\nAnd that car will have Arm inside, so we both win. Alex, thanks so much.\nRene Haas\nIf you want to learn more about Wayve and their software strategy, keep an eye out for an upcoming conversation with their VP of Engineering, Silvius Rus, on the Arm Viewpoints podcast.

He also shares details with Rene about his roots growing up among scientists near Los Alamos National Laboratory and how he’s learned to manage stress through math competitions, which has also helped him get to where he is today.\n[00:00:07] Rene Haas\nWelcome to Tech Unheard, a podcast that takes you behind the scenes of the most exciting developments in technology...\n[00:00:41] Alexandr Wang\nThanks for having me. Super excited.\n[00:00:43] Rene Haas\nYeah, thank you. One of the things I like to start with is folks’ background...\n[00:01:13] Alexandr Wang\nYeah. So I was born in Los Alamos, New Mexico...\n[00:02:02] Rene Haas\nDid you go to a public high school?\n[00:02:04] Alexandr Wang\nYes, there's a great public school system...\n[00:03:25] Rene Haas\nWhat was the competition like in middle school?\n[00:03:29] Alexandr Wang\nThere were tons of clubs. I remember in fourth grade...\n[00:26:16] Rene Haas\nThanks for listening to this month's episode of Tech Unheard...\n[00:26:37] Credits\nTech Unheard is a custom podcast series from Arm and National Public Media...\nJoin Aicha Evans, CEO of Zoox, the Amazon autonomous vehicle subsidiary, as she talks with Arm CEO Rene Haas about her career journey from a young girl in Senegal all the way to her current role and the challenges ahead for autonomous vehicles.\nAicha also shares candid insights into the early days of her career, her thoughts on the semiconductor industry after her stint at Intel, and how she balances work and family life.\nRene Haas (03:04)\nAisha, thank you so much for joining.\nAicha Evans (03:21)\nMy pleasure. I’m so looking forward to this. We’re going to have fun.\nRene Haas (03:37)\nSo Aisha, you and I had lunch a while back.\nYou told me a little bit about your background, which was utterly fascinating in terms of not only where you grew up and got started, but how you got into engineering in this field. So recast that for the audience, it’s just a fascinating story.\nAicha Evans (04:22)\nYeah, I do remember that lunch too and many dinners since. Look, I’m from Senegal, West Africa. My dad was in telecommunication engineering back then, sort of France was wiring up Senegal and other countries. And I grew up, I ended up growing up in Paris back and forth. And every time I was in Senegal and I wanted to talk to my friends in Paris, I couldn’t really. I remember this is pre-internet and what have you. And so we had a rotary phone. And yeah, I decided to figure out how to hack it because it had a little lock.\nRene Haas (04:57)\nHa ha.\nAicha Evans (04:58)\nLock on it so you couldn’t make phone calls. Now in retrospect, really, it was sort of silly because then the phone bill came and my dad was like, what is going on here? But I just saw the difference when you have technology available, what it makes possible versus when you don’t in two countries that I love. And then I happen to be good at math, physics, not biology, by the way. And so that’s how I fell in love with STEM and building things, hacking things, and I do like the combination of hardware and software. And then eventually came to the US to study computer engineering and the rest is history.\nRene Haas (05:37)\nSo born in Paris and then lived in Senegal or born in… So, and what was the back and forth to Paris then? Why that?\nAicha Evans (05:41)\nThe other way around. Born in Senegal and then yeah.\nSo my Dad had this, it’s funny, he wanted me to have that education and really be around sort of elite people in STEM, but he also wanted me to remain very Senegalese and so family, friends. So every vacation I did Air Africa, Air France, Paris, Dakar for maybe a week, a couple weeks, and that’s how I sort of stayed in touch with my original country and do to this day, this summer will be Dakar and London.\nRene Haas (06:20)\nAmazing, amazing. And the lock on the rotary phone, was that to disable country codes? What was that lock about?\nAicha Evans (06:28)\nIt was, it turns out to first of all, back then not a lot of households had those. And so there were issues with sort of people going to somebody else’s house and making phone calls. And so this was locking it so that only authorized people with the key could make a phone call because it was so expensive except that one of the unauthorized people was me, the daughter who wanted to talk to my friends in Paris.\nRene Haas (06:44)\nMy goodness gracious.\nFantastic. I grew up in the United States, but my mother was Portuguese, my father was German who grew up in Lisbon. similar thing in that they would make calls overseas. And we didn’t have a lock on the phone, but I would remember usually every month when the phone bill came in, my father being in complete stupor, finding out what calls my mom had made overseas.\nAicha Evans (07:22)\nIt was crazy back then. I tell the kids today who at the moment noticed are on a video call with friends all around the world and they’re like, you just don’t know how good you have it.\nRene Haas (07:30)\nYeah. Yeah, no, the world got unbelievably flat. So where did you go to university?\nAicha Evans (07:39)\nGW in DC, which is yet another story. Finally, he agreed, my dad, that I could go to the US, but he wanted me to go in DC where he had a lot of friends at World Bank, IMF. There was also a small contingent of Senegalese students because he was like, okay, in Paris, I lost control of this child. She’s this little French girl. She’s smoking, dating, drinking, going out. We’re not doing that again.\nRene Haas (08:02)\nYou\nAicha Evans (08:07)\nAnd the funny story is very shortly after being in the States, I met my American husband. And so the recipe didn’t really work out too well.\nRene Haas (08:18)\nAnd studied engineering or computer science? was your studies?\nAicha Evans (08:22)\nIt was computer engineering, so I had this thing that I didn’t like electrical engineering. I like hardware. I like to build things. But you could already tell that computers were taking over. And computer science I liked, but I was going to miss the hardware. So there was this mixed degree that’s kind of nice where you do a little bit of both, which worked out really well for me.\nRene Haas (08:41)\nInteresting, interesting. I didn’t know that story, but my degree is also in computer engineering and actually for the very same reason. Electroengineering, electromagnetic fields and waves, that stuff I did, power circuitry, transformers, good to learn. But computer engineering, when I was in college was really the time of, the PCs were just starting.\nAicha Evans (08:57)\nYou get it.\nRene Haas (09:07)\nAnd I had worked, around with Commodore 64s and VIC-20s in high school. So very similar. Computer engineering was exactly what I was attracted to as well. So I knew we had something in common here.\nAicha Evans (09:20)\nThere we go, now it makes sense.\nRene Haas (09:22)\nAnd then what? So you’re out of GW. What is your first role?\nAicha Evans (09:26)\nI am at, well first was stay for grad school and don’t stay for grad school but married, my husband had a job in Austin and so that was kind of like, you want me to move where? Austin, Texas, are you crazy? But we did and it turned out to be a good decision so I went to work for Sky, well back then it was called Brook Three which was, yep.\nRene Haas (09:49)\nOh sure, yeah,\nAicha Evans (09:51)\nA big startup and…\nRene Haas (09:52)\nYep.\nAicha Evans (09:52)\nTotally bombed the interview too. I don’t know why they hired me or at least that’s how it felt. But it was great. I was the youngest by many, many years and they just took me under their wing and worked on essentially AV sync. Back then recording live video was just starting and streaming and then quickly, I think four years or five years in with my big mouth and always having opinions moved into management. At first the tech lead and then from there went to, where did I go? Skyworks and started working on cell phones. I was just talking this morning about sending those first text messages on a small little LCD screen and saying, yeah, it’s gonna be computers in your pocket soon.\nRene Haas (10:32)\nMy goodness. So very, but we’re two for two here, because my first job out of college was also in Texas, and I was with TI, and so gosh, at Houston, so we’re two for two here. But Brooktree, I remember they were doing like RAM DAX and analog, how big was Brooktree? Because when I joined TI, you know, a monstrous company, how big was Brooktree?\nAicha Evans (10:59)\nAbout 500 people working on the project was with, I think it was EchoStar maybe, and basically what were you gonna do with storage and replay and synchronization, the audio and the video are recorded separately, so they sent me to Sarnoff Research Labs in New Jersey to learn about all that, and that was my area of the chip and the product.\nRene Haas (11:08)\nSure, yeah, yeah, yeah. So when I joined TI, they were a giant company. I think they were the largest semiconductor company in the world. To be honest, I knew no different about joining a small company versus a big company. But Brooktree must have been interesting. Did you have a desire to join a company of 500 people? Because when you’re going to go of college and you’re new to everything, it’s not obvious how the culture is going to be at a small company versus big company, how one’s going to fit. did you end up there? How did you end up at Brooktree?\nAicha Evans (11:59)\nOkay, so I have to be careful here. So this is what happened. I joined a big company. And I spent two weeks at the big company because it was the right thing to do and because I was on a senior project at GW with them. But then when I went to work, I was like, this is not going to work. This dude,\nRene Haas (12:08)\nOkay.\nHa ha ha.\nAicha Evans (12:29)\nWas like, you’re gonna do this? I felt like I had a roadmap of tasks with no thinking for five years ahead of me. And so I quit. I was like, and they were like, how, two weeks. So then they said, hey, are you sure you’re intimidated? I said, no, this is not gonna work. I have opinions, I need to think, I need to be part of things, and I can just tell I’m not gonna be happy here.\nRene Haas (12:29)\nWow. Within two months? Two weeks.\nAicha Evans (12:57)\nAnd so they gave me two more weeks of vacation to kind of get my mind right because they thought I was just scared and I never went back. And during those two weeks, I looked at the Austin Statesman, think was the thing, the Sunday pages. And there was this ad from Brook Three that said, come make waves with us together. And I called them and I said, hi, I’m Aisha Evans.\nRene Haas (13:18)\nGosh.\nAicha Evans (13:22)\nI’d love to work for you and they’re like send your resume in I sent my resume in and then they called me in for an interview and I interviewed and then I got an offer and I was screaming first time I had ever done anything by myself for myself\nRene Haas (13:30)\nGosh. But you had obviously shown some level of entrepreneurial risk taking and no, really seriously, and courage because to know something at that young age isn’t right for you and to make a decision that fast is pretty amazing. that, looking back, is that something you look back and say, gosh, what was I thinking? I was crazy? Or do you look back and say, that was me and that’s how I think about things.\nAicha Evans (14:04)\nNo, I mean, I’m not saying it’s good or bad. It’s just me. By the way, there are also other sides of the issue where I love to cook. This is something that makes me happy, cooking and making dish and doing dishes. And so you are now in the US. Even though DC is very international, there is no Senegalese food and I need my Senegalese food. So I make my Senegalese food. My friends tell me how much they love my Senegalese food. I come into a little bit of money and I decide it’s a good idea to start a restaurant. So I buy a restaurant with my American boyfriend who we’ve been together for three months. And I learned a lot about leadership at that restaurant. Turns out the dishwasher dude, he’s the boss. And so I did that for a year now, like back to computers, please. Let’s go back to the regular program. So sometimes it’s kind of crazy. In retrospect, I want to ask my parents-in-law.\nRene Haas (14:35)\nMy gosh. Ha\nAicha Evans (14:58)\nI mean, they were probably like, this woman, what is she doing? But I don’t know. That’s just me. I’m weird.\nRene Haas (15:03)\nWas the Senegalese restaurant done in parallel with your career or was it a hiatus and you went up and said I’m going to go do a restaurant for a bit?\nAicha Evans (15:11)\nSo first I thought it was going to be done in parallel. It quickly became clear that that was not going to happen. So I ended up taking a semester off and then going back to school.\nRene Haas (15:23)\nUnbelievable, I did not know that story, that is amazing. So after Skyworks, is that what brought you to Intel or was there something in between there?\nAicha Evans (15:34)\nIt was being married 10 years, not wanting to have children because anytime I’m around children, it’s loud, it’s complicated, and you have a responsibility. And then all of a sudden, you decide that, no, no, no, you want to have children. And so it was, OK, I need to slow down and have kids. It ended up being difficult also having kids. Now I can talk about it publicly because it’s been a long time, but had a very difficult miscarriage.\nRene Haas (16:02)\nMm.\nAicha Evans (16:02)\nAnd so I was like, okay, the new project is to have a kid. So I left. But then in the meantime, until after I had my first child, was like, hey, we’re looking for wireless people because of WiMAX. And we happen to live in Portland, Oregon. So it was very practical. So I kind of, you’re going to say this woman, I kind of eventually said, fine, I’ll come to work for you. But\nRene Haas (16:19)\nSure.\nAicha Evans (16:30)\nFor the first year, no travel because I had a three-month-old brand new baby that I really wanted to have. And I think I said something like nine to four. And they said, okay, fine, no problem, just for the first year. And of course, I went in there and, you know, that’s not what ended up happening. I ended up working like crazy and traveling. But I also figured out how to, I wouldn’t say balance because I think that’s a myth, but integrate being a mom and working. So yeah, it was Wimax that got me there.\nRene Haas (16:43)\nRight. So do you have, and I have two daughters and their mom did not work when the kids were growing up, which I think was hugely beneficial to them. And now my youngest daughter has had a baby and she’s also staying home for a bit. But I look at that and then I think about your story, which is just amazing. i mean, what…\nAicha Evans (17:15)\nCongrats!\nRene Haas (17:28)\nHow did you do that?\nAicha Evans (17:42)\nYou’re too kind. So a few things. So first of all, you know how in when you’re on an airplane they say you have to put your oxygen mask first before you help anybody else? I like working. I enjoy it. It makes me happy.\nRene Haas (18:00)\nYeah.\nAicha Evans (18:07)\nThat journey from the young Senegalese girl all the way to here required a lot of managing myself and understanding what’s important to me. So I like working, I like creating things, I like having an impact. I love my kids, I have two of them, one is now 19, the other one 17. I have a wonderful husband, a wonderful support system. By the time, remember, I said I waited 10 years, so how it worked out for me is that by the time I had them, I could make choices and afford choices in terms of what I did myself versus what I got support for versus frankly what I outsourced. And so I built a wonderful flexible support system around myself and I have a wonderful husband too and we partnered in doing that. And along the years sometimes I sped up from a career or impact standpoint. Sometimes I took a step back and just kind of ebbed and flowed.\nRene Haas (19:01)\nFor folks listening who might be thinking about those choices, is there anything that you look back and say, had I known X, I may have done something a little bit differently.\nAicha Evans (19:19)\nNot particularly when it comes to raising the kids. would say, well, the jurors start out, they are young, so we’ll see. But so far they are wonderful kids. Look, the thing I would have told myself is something that applies to almost everything in my life. That same entrepreneurial, risky, seeks sort of crazy things, wants to have high impact, sometimes also goes out of control and is too intense. And so I would say, Take a chill pill is what I would have told my younger self. In general, it works out. then, yeah, that’s probably what I would have told myself. As far as the advice, you just need to be consequential. Be happy and be consequential. So when you make the decisions, make sure you understand the pros and cons, and be happy with the pros and live with the cons.\nRene Haas (19:51)\nThat is absolutely wonderful advice. now you’re at Intel, certainly not a small company at the time, and probably pretty close to the peak of their strength as a company. And you were there, what, 12 years? what were the areas that you worked inside of Intel?\nAicha Evans (20:27)\nIndeed. Twelve years. So it was mostly 10 years of wireless because when I came, when I went in with Wimax, I was kind of like, wow, they’re either onto something incredible or something’s really wrong. So it turned out that the idea was correct, but the implementation, mean, Wimax is a great technology, but when you look at the incumbency of 3GPP back then, that was almost mission impossible in terms of the ecosystem, network operators. I ended up meeting, it was sort of fortitude, I was in some open forum type thing with David and Sean. David Perlmuter back then ran all of engineering and Sean ran kind of the business. And they were sort of outside the CEO, they were kind of like running the company. And I put my hand up and I said, hi, I’m Aisha Evans. I have a question, I work on WiMAX, and I see all these challenges, and so I’d like to understand what’s the goal? What are we trying to do? And so they responded, but that got me an audience with them afterwards. And so it ended up being that Grove had seen that the PC and the connected world were going to converge. And so having a wireless portfolio was important. License, IE modems, unlicense, IE Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GNSS, that type of stuff. I basically worked on building those products for mostly PCs, a little bit of edge devices, and then a smartphone from a company that I’m not allowed to name.\nAnd that’s what I did for a long time, enjoyed it, had a great team worldwide and was in the soup with operators and base stations and it was really fun. Back then MWC in Barcelona in February was a must. And yeah, that’s what I was doing. But in doing that, I started, it almost felt like a startup inside of Intel. I don’t know how to say it because everybody else was doing processor memory and what have you.\nRene Haas (22:27)\nAbsolutely. Mm-hmm. Yep.\nAicha Evans (22:40)\nAnd then there were changes and then I received the directive to make a couple of changes. One was a processor change and the other one was to build internally, i.e. not at TSMC. And that’s when I encountered the beast.\nRene Haas (22:49)\nYeah, and we promise not to go too deep on the Intel thing, but the one thing I always, I look at Intel and I think a super power to some extent is vertical integration, I thought to some extent because I go back to my early days at TI and then back in the day, we built everything internally. We built testers and memory access and all the programming. And it just seems to me that\nAicha Evans (23:02)\nIt’s okay.\nIndeed.\nRene Haas (23:26)\nThe strong coupling between the process and the product is a pretty amazing power if they can get it right. Without getting too deep in the Intel broader strategy, when you think about vertical integration in semiconductors versus the horizontal model, do you have a perspective on, in the long game, which should win, or one way the other?\nAicha Evans (23:47)\nI don’t think about them that way. First of all, I always kind of go back to what I call the helicopter view, meaning above the forest. Success is poison. If you don’t manage your success and you lose track of what is the basis of your success and is that basis a truth that is self-evident and should continue or be modified, thou shall run into trouble. And so there is absolutely no doubt that the vertical integration is a strength, but if it’s not done in a way that is flexible and modular and can quickly adapt to trend, either in the building, the material, the testing, or the cadence of the market, trouble arises. And then you go into protect and defend mode, and that is never, ever a winning strategy.\nRene Haas (24:41)\nI 1,000 % agree. i mean, the technology graveyard of tech companies is filled with companies that have done just that. And I was in Austin doing a fireside chat at South by Southwest. And we were literally chatting about that and that just how punishing our industry can be if you miss a window and you think your past success is a predictor of a future strategy, you are going to be in huge trouble.\nAicha Evans (24:53)\nYeah.\nRene Haas (25:07)\nYou made a very brave move to go to a technology area that I think everyone would know and would disagree that autonomous vehicles and autonomy in general is what’s going to happen. So your move to Zoox, now you’ve gone from something that’s very big to something that’s not so big, but in some ways was fairly well capitalized. What made that jump for, what was the jump to Zoox all about?\nAicha Evans (25:36)\nWell, towards the, kind of, I don’t think you should wake up every morning thinking 100 % of the time you’re gonna be happy at work. But you know, the majority of the time you should be happy and energized and you’re learning and you know, and you’re contributing. And towards the end, at Intel, I could feel that, you know, I had more unhappy days than happy days. Let me put it that way. Not because people were mean or anything like that. It’s just, I didn’t agree. And so I’m starting now to, you know, I’m very curious. That’s how we’ve met, but I’m stuck. I’m one of those who says, hi, my name is Aisha Evans. I need some help, please. I don’t understand. May you please help me? And so I had met a lot of people in the industry and a lot of folks were telling me, should go do this. You should go do that. And…\nRene Haas (26:11)\nYep, absolutely.\nAicha Evans (26:26)\nI don’t know that I knew what I wanted to do exactly, but I knew how I wanted to spend my time. And so I was getting a lot of offers and I’m not trying to sound arrogant or anything like that. That’s just what happened. A lot of phone calls. And eventually I got one about Zoox. By the way, I first told the recruiter, I don’t think so, because we had, Intel had bought Mobileye. So I had a little bit of a window into that ADAS AV world.\nRene Haas (26:50)\nYeah.\nAicha Evans (26:55)\nand we were also supplying wireless cards to EV folks. And so I was like, these people, no, this sounds crazy. But then a couple of people that I really trust told me, hey, you should go talk to them. They might be onto something. And so first, of course, I meet board members. I like them. And then I meet Jesse Levinson, one of the two co-founders. We walked around Zoox for about a couple hours. And I don’t know, it’s one of those when you know, you know.\nI just fell in love with the idea and the product. I felt the vibe. I could see myself spending the time that way. It’s a product that matters. It’s been a while since there’s been, in physical transportation, since there’s been like a big revolution. And it just makes sense. I mean, I was like, we’re not building that many more roads and how many more cars can we stuff? Plus I hope that 10 years, 20 years from now, we ask ourselves how it was okay for 40,000 plus people to pass and that’s just okay. And so it just, they had a business model that made sense to me. And so I came home and I told my husband, I think I’m leaving and this is what I’m doing. And so then we went on vacation for I think two weeks in Jamaica and I sat there on the beach and.\nRene Haas (28:11)\nHahaha\nAicha Evans (28:19)\nYou know, I trust my intuition a lot and my intuition didn’t say don’t do this. So I came back and told Intel and then took like a little bit of detox time and then started in February 2019. Haven’t looked back and I still giggle every day.\nRene Haas (28:35)\nSix years, and the progress that you’ve made has been incredible. I do want to touch on that, but I want to dig into a comment you just made because I see that in your personality. You’re not afraid to ask for help. I’ve been a CEO now for three years. You’ve been one for six. It’s not always easy for the CEO to stand up and say, I need help. People look at us and say, the buck stops there. You’re the answer man or the answer woman. How do you balance that because you’re great at it in terms of the I’ll ask for help when I need it But at the same time, I’m the CEO and should I be seen as asking for help?\nAicha Evans (29:17)\nSo I think being open and transparent is extremely important. i think telling people the why before you get to the how is really important. My job right now at least is to get some 2,800 people or so from many different backgrounds, Some are traditional automotive, some are new automotive, some are AI geniuses, some are mechanics, some are embedded people, some are policy and regulatory people, some are comms and marketing people, some are product experience. I am not an expert at all that. Number one. Number two, I already know what I think. What’s most important is what I don’t think and that’s good. And so my job is to treat everybody as a customer. kind of take all of that input in, synthesize it. If there are better ideas, say thank you and tell me more and let’s do it. If my idea is bad, I’m in a safety critical business. People trust me with their lives in our robotaxi. I would want a culture where if people think we’re doing something wrong or unsafe that they tell us. So to me, it’s more like earning it.\nRene Haas (30:33)\nYeah, perfect, perfect answer. That’s how I feel about it. And in fact, the CEO probably has the good excuse that can say, I’m an expert of nothing, so teach me something. And I find that my own job here. I learn every day from folks who I interact with. So much has happened in Autonomous in the short time that you’ve been with Zoox, although six years maybe doesn’t seem like a short time. When you started, large language models, vision-based learning, that was not a thing. And now, six years into this, what has changed, if anything at all, relative to how you think about autonomous and the rules and how that gets handled in the light of these new models that seem to be just incredible in terms of learning?\nAicha Evans (31:30)\nFirst of all, AV is a space where it’s important to ask a question first, which is, is there a driver behind the driver’s seat? Yes or no? So if our view is that if there’s a driver behind the driver’s seat, but that driver can be distracted, that driver is not fully in charge of the driving, they are just in charge of making sure they are available to take over. basically supervised versus unsupervised. So I think that LLMs have accelerated things, but for us, where there are no manual controls and there is no human driver, so there is no takeover because we don’t want the customer involved in the driving, LLMs have been more helpful in simulation, in the magnitude and the speed at which we can process edge cases, the understanding cost, just because you have to, in our case, supplement cameras, that doesn’t mean you have to, like, if we were redesigning our robotaxi today, I’m pretty confident it would have less sensors than it does today. And then in terms of also anything that requires a lot of estimation and forecasting, so it’s been an accelerant for us. We are not yet at the point where we’re thinking,\nRene Haas (32:37)\nRight.\nAicha Evans (32:51)\nWithout any manual control, it will do the driving by itself. We think that from a safety standpoint, and the easiest way, not everybody lives in this technology, but if you prompt one of, pick your favorite agent, and you give it a prompt and it gives you an answer that’s slightly right and a little wrong, that’s not a big deal. Well, when it’s in real time control of a robot taxi, that is a big deal. So that’s the gap we’re maneuvering. But we think that over the next, I’m sure that gap will narrow and narrow and narrow over time given how fast things are going.\nRene Haas (33:25)\nYeah, that does feel like something that time can address and the models are moving remarkably fast in terms of not only their learning and reasoning capability, but just simply you throw more compute at it. To get to a point where you think the models are actually end quote good enough to be a good augment to what you’re a couple years away, multiple years away,\nAicha Evans (33:55)\nThere are already a good augment now. There are many times when you have perception and mapping and localization, but then really the pipe is perception, and well, prediction, planning and control. First of all, prediction and planning and control have basically merged. And second of all, every trajectory has essentially, there is a machine-learned version that is generated. It’s just we don’t pick it all the time. So it’s happening.\nRene Haas (34:22)\nRight. to get to a point where it’s picked the majority of the time or 90 % of the time, how far away is that?\nAicha Evans (34:31)\nI think 90 % of the time is very soon. The problem is when we get to 95, 99 % of the time, I think to get to that last 1 % is where it’s going to be very hard. Because even if it can, we want to know that it can every single time. And that’s the little funnel that’s difficult to deal with. But it’ll come.\nRene Haas (34:35)\nAnd well. is the threshold, you mentioned 40,000, 50,000 that death a year in auto accidents, which is just awful. Yet it seems like with autonomy, the threshold for accidents is,\nRene Haas (35:26)\nEssentially zero.. How, how, where do you think the threshold level is relative to the tolerance for, for accidents? And I know this is kind of a crazy subject relative to trading off humanity, but in reality,\nAicha Evans (35:27)\nMm-hmm.\nRene Haas (35:54)\nDoes it need to get to essentially zero for this to be able to be broadly and widely accepted? Is it regulatory? Is it insurance? How do you think about all that?\nAicha Evans (36:02)\nNo, so I’m trying to give you the best answer that I can give you. I’ll answer it in a philosophical way. I think you have to be trusted. People have to trust that you know how important this is and you’re trying for zero. And there has to be a track record holistically, whether you’re dealing with regulatory, the community, your own engineering, your own methodology. There has to be a track record. You have to develop a track record of transparency, communication, and how you talk and how you do things so that people trust that you’re trying for zero. I think if that, and also it has to happen. mean, look. the human benchmarks are fairly clear. We can argue about 10 or 20K here and there, it’s around, no matter how you look at it, it’s around 10 to, let’s say, 50K when it comes to collision. It’s around 30 to 100 million when it comes to, sorry, when it comes to injuries and then fatalities, right? So, You can’t really, you know, if, for example, if Zoox deploys a robot taxi and has something really bad happen after two miles, we do not deserve to be trusted. So I think you have to build all those muscles and have a lot of transparency and make sure that you build your safety case in a way that some of the tougher incidents happen down the road so that you have enough of a track record of that so people know you tried.\nRene Haas (37:21)\nRight, right, right.\nAicha Evans (37:42)\nAnd then they come and then you have to explain what happened and make sure that you, nobody has the impression that you didn’t tell them what happened. Even if you did, know, perception is reality, you’re a CEO, you know how that works. And then you have to show what you’re gonna do differently.\nRene Haas (37:57)\nTotally. Do you think it’s a couple years of having no accidents, for example? I was wondering, because I think about air travel, which is unbelievably safe, even given the issues that have taken place horribly over the last number of months. Statistically, it’s incredibly safe. And statistics will show, and have shown, that the vast majority of airline crashes was pilot error. Yet when I look at autonomous, just to your numbers, I would almost think that the math will be there very soon, that they will be less than what you just cited. Yet I also feel like today’s culture and philosophy is almost a zero tolerance. And I just wonder how we get through that threshold.\nAicha Evans (38:45)\nSo it’s interesting you should say that. I work in foster city, so I see the planes landing all the time. Aviation, no matter what we say, over a lot of miles in the air, over a lot of takeoffs and landings in a very ubiquitous way, has shown and proven that it tries for zero, very rarely.\nVery seldomly, when something bad happens, but we have this contract that we trust the process. And I think that autonomy, especially unsupervised autonomy, is working its way there. But the bar should be high, because we’re trading people’s lives, and that’s important.\nRene Haas (39:31)\nYeah, 100%.\nAicha Evans (39:34)\nOne last thing though, You have to deliver value too. Because you know what? You can decide that airplanes are not safe and you’re not flying. Well, that’s going to limit a lot of things in your. And we have to, so we have to deliver value at the same time.\nRene Haas (39:38)\nFor sure.\nYeah, Just a last couple of questions, Aisha. When I became a CEO, a lot of folks asked me afterwards, what surprised you about being CEO? And there were so many things. But a small one was that I didn’t quite realize was just how the eyes are on you all the time. And that’s from an employee standpoint. used to, the job I had before running the company was I had the number two job in the company, which was a big job, et cetera, et cetera. But I would notice I could walk down the hall and people would maybe not look at me and not say hello. And when you’re the CEO, I think everyone is watching you and making sure that not only they wanna say hi or hello, which is obviously great, but they’re also reading your body language and such.\nAicha Evans (40:41)\nFor sure.\nRene Haas (40:49)\nYou’ve been at CEO for six years. What was something that has surprised you about the role?\nAicha Evans (40:55)\nDefinitely what you said, but in addition, how bloody lonely it is, It’s just lonely. It’s very isolating. It’s funny because you’re isolated in public. On the one hand, you have to do exactly what you said, shoulders up, because I’m on stage, people are reading my slightest body language or smile or nod of the head or how I’m talking to somebody or wagging my finger.\nRene Haas (40:59)\nHaha\nAicha Evans (41:22)\nAnd at the same time, yeah, sometimes I just need to let loose and I’m not sure or I’m scared or I am hilariously happy. And it’s just, it feels like you’re just, you’re always in public, but you’re also so lonely.\nRene Haas (41:36)\nThat is very well stated and that’s why I do this podcast and I have people like you on because it’s my one time of the day to feel not such a lonely person. Last question and this is something I’ve never quite been able to figure out the answer to. Why is the bread in France so much better than anything you can find anywhere else in the world? What is the secret sauce there?\nAicha Evans (41:56)\nLook, I don’t know and I’m not a baker, but hang on, hang on, hang on. But I have something. one of my daughter’s best friends, he’s French and the mom is French and they’ve known each other since middle school. And I can tell you that I’m very mad that they just moved to Paris because when we are invited, when we used to be invited, to get an invite to their house for dinner.\nRene Haas (41:58)\nWhat?\nAicha Evans (42:24)\nIn Los Altos, I’d be like, my god, this is going to be like the bread in Paris. And so I finally asked her and I said, hey, how come you’re able to do this? And I’m not able to buy this anywhere. Now you’re sitting down. She imported every single ingredient from the butter to the flour to the salt. mean, every single ingredient she imported to make the bread.\nRene Haas (42:38)\nI’m sitting down.\nI have to believe that’s probably the case because what I have found is either one of two things. People have imported all the ingredients or they do what you just did and don’t tell me what the answer is in the beginning for somebody who lived in Paris. Aisha Evans, thank you so much for spending the time with us. This was wonderful.\nAicha Evans (43:10)\nMy pleasure, Rene. Good to see you.\nRene Haas (43:12)\nMerci beaucoup.\nChris Miller: Explaining Why Some Countries Fail to Capitalize on Technological Progress\nJoin Chris Miller, author of the book, Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, and Arm CEO Rene Haas as they discuss the role of the semiconductor industry in the story of economic globalization and the challenges facing governments around the world.\nHere, Chris shares the genesis for the book with Rene, and gives us fascinating insights into the past, present, and future of the increasingly pervasive computer chip.\n[00:00:00] Rene Haas: Welcome to Tech Unheard, the podcast that takes you behind the scenes of the most exciting developments in technology. I’m Rene Haas, your host and CEO of Arm. Today, I’m joined by Chris Miller, Economic Historian at the Fletcher School at Tufts University and Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\nChris is the author of several books, including most recently Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology. He sat down with me to talk about his work as a leading academic in the semiconductor industry.\nChris, thanks so much for joining me.\n[00:00:39] Chris Miller: Good to see you, and thanks for having me.\n[00:00:41] Rene Haas: Oh, my pleasure. We are in incredibly interesting times here, January of 2025, as we get into the new year and everything associated with new administration. There’s a lot of things that we can cover that’s going to impact our industry, but you and I connected a few years ago when you were writing this book, Chip War, which is a magnificent piece of work, and we’ll talk more about that. But I’d like to maybe start, Chris, and just maybe have you give your background, how you got into the field that you did. However, you want to tell the story.\n[00:01:13] Chris Miller: Fantastic. Well, as you know, I have no background in semiconductors or anything related to them. I’m a historian by training, studied history in college, decided that I wanted to pursue a career as a historian and so did a PhD in economic history and in particular in Russian economic history, which surprises a lot of people because there aren’t that many connections between Russian economic history and the semiconductor industry. But one of the questions that I got really interested in was what explains why some countries, despite having brilliant technologists and scientists and Nobel Prize winners, seem to have a lot of the key ingredients for technological progress but nevertheless failed to actually capitalize on them. That was the fate of Russia over the last couple of decades. And so I got interested in, well, why was Russia, despite having a lot of the preconditions, not nearly as good at computing as you might think. And that’s how I first got interested in why the US has an extraordinary semiconductor industry and Russia failed to develop one despite its extraordinary scientific and technological talent.\n[00:02:19] Rene Haas: And why history? Why Russia? Were you, when you were growing up, enamored with going to museums and understanding history? And obviously I don’t have a degree in history, but I find that if you look back in history, it teaches you almost everything about the present and the future. But what was the catalyst for you? And what kind of got your curiosity into all that?\n[00:02:37] Chris Miller: You know, I think it was, it was similar, desire to understand how the world came to be the way it is. And, you know, I’d studied a bit of economics and a bit of social sciences and found all those interesting, but the best lens for really making sense of the world actually seemed to be to understand how it came to be. And so to me, history was both fascinating in its own right, but also I think really illuminating for making sense of the world as it is today.\n[00:03:03] Rene Haas: And the angle in Russia, was it USSR or was it Peter the Great? Or how far back into Russian history and economics?\n[00:03:14] Chris Miller: You know, I started by getting very interested in the history of the Soviet Union. I was born in 1987, so I don’t really have any memories of when the Soviet Union actually existed. And when I started studying it, it seemed like this extraordinary alternative universe, with a totally different economic and social structure, which made no sense, but nevertheless existed for a full 70 years, an entire human lifespan in a country. And so that’s what first got me curious as to how did this country and this system work. But then eventually I ended up writing both one book on the Soviet Union and one book that stretches all the way back to Peter the Great and spent a number of years living in Russia as well and still have great affection for the entire history and culture of the country.\n[00:03:58] Rene Haas: Oh my gosh. So do you speak Russian?\n[00:03:59] Chris Miller: I do. Yes. Yeah. I spent a lot of time there before the political dynamics changed for the worse the last couple of years.\n[00:04:06] Rene Haas: And I remember, you know, you and I were chatting in fact when you wrote the book, and I remember at the time a story internally, that I got an email, a blind email from a gentleman who was a history professor who wanted to talk to me. And I was thinking to myself, why does a history professor want to talk to the CEO of Arm. But I found the story of how you, maybe stumbled is not the right word but I’ll use it anyway, how you stumbled into telling the story that you did, because my understanding was that was not originally the story that you were intending to write, i.e. the history and story of the semiconductor industry.\n[00:04:37] Chris Miller: That’s right. I really did start with the origins of the Russian semiconductor industry, which I thought was curious insofar as it wasn’t developed at all. Despite that, you know, just a couple of years after the first integrated circuits were invented in the US the Russians, or the Soviets at the time, were trying to build their own. And so the first question was, well, why did the US succeed and Russia fail? But as I was doing that research, I came to realize that although I sort of knew chips were everywhere in my phone and in my PC, I, like I think most people, hadn’t really realized just how pervasive they’d come across our entire lives. And I also hadn’t realized the extent to which the story of economic globalization, which everyone sort of knew, was in large part driven by the chip industry and how semiconductors were probably the best case study and how a product can be designed in one company and manufactured in a second and assembled in the third using chemicals from a fourth. There was really no more complex production process than semiconductors. And so you combine the sort of question of the rise of the modern tech sector with the rise of globalization. You couldn’t understand any of that without really putting semiconductors at the center of your analysis. And like most people, I knew what chips were vaguely, but I’d never really thought about them as being important. And yet, as I looked at the world, I realized I couldn’t really make sense of anything unless I understood better how this industry functions.\n[00:06:02] Rene Haas: What were some of the things as you got into your research? And as I said, the research you did on this book was just magnificent. I’ve talked to a number of colleagues and I started in the semiconductor industry in the middle eighties, so before you were born. And colleagues of mine reading the book, we just felt like, my gosh, we’re reading the story of our careers in terms of how you just cover the entire landscape. But what were some of the surprises as you started to do your research and talk to the key influencers in the industry, what were some of the things that were most surprising to you?\n[00:06:32] Chris Miller: Well, I think the first surprise really was the pervasiveness of semiconductors. You know, I, as I mentioned, I knew there were chips in computers and phones, but I think like most people, I hadn’t really come to terms with the fact that there were hundreds of chips in a typical car, for example, or in basically every electronic around my home from my fridge to my microwave, there were chips. Or that as you connected more devices together, that was all driven by improvements in semiconductors. I’d sort of thought of all those as discrete parts of the economy, whereas in reality, it’s chips that unite them all together. So that was one big surprise, just the centrality of semiconductors and enabling every sector of the economy to grow. The second surprise was looking at the way in which no one, not a single country in the world was anywhere close to self-sufficient and producing their own semiconductors. And you had these extraordinary value chains stretching across every major economy. And it was this collective effort that made possible the innovations that semiconductors required and that they in turn enabled. That was a surprise to me. And the third surprise was something that I’d been aware of through kind of discussions of Moore’s law, but had never really thought about, and I think most people haven’t really thought about what it means to have exponential growth over half a century. And that dynamic, when you compare it to any other segment of the economy, is totally extraordinary. And thinking through what that has enabled, I think was the third surprise. I sort of knew about it, but I never really thought about it. And when you do start to think about it, it really is a mind boggling in terms of the rate of progress.\n[00:08:10] Rene Haas: Now there was a point in time where the US was quite vertically integrated as far as semiconductors go. And I, again, I started my career back at TI and back in the day TI had fabs all over Texas. There were packaging facilities in Texas. The test equipment that we used at TI to test chips were based in the United States. Was it just economics, do you think that pushed them offshore, and them not being TI, but the whole industry? And, or, if you look back in terms of the decision that drove that, could the US have done anything different relative to keeping that capability inside the United States?\n[00:08:49] Chris Miller: You know, I think one of the most fun parts of my research was interviewing folks from companies like TI who were working there even before you in the fifties and sixties. I had a chance to speak to some people who were in the really early stages of the industry. And as you allude to, they were producing not just their own test equipment, but their own materials, their own wafers, their own chemicals. Everything was done in house and you had to do it like that at the start because that was, there were no suppliers. But one of the things that I think I realized was that as technology got more complex, it just became impossible for one company to specialize in ultra purified chemicals and ultra complex software tools and ultra capable lithography systems. You had to have the value chain split out into different companies so that you could have the specialization that made technological progress possible. So, I think that dynamic was certainly inevitable. The fact you have not just integrated but separate suppliers for different types of components and processes. I think it was also to some degree inevitable and in a lot of ways a good thing that you had a integrated supply chain that stretched across all the world’s advanced economies because it meant that you could defray capital costs of investments, not just in the US, but also globally. And so it was a good thing you were able to access the Japanese market in European markets and Asian markets, etcetera as well. And I think the third thing was that as the technology became more specialized and you know, I think if you look at lithography, which I spent a lot of time studying there’s great examples of this, you really needed the combined expertise of the best optical experts in Germany, plus the best chemical experts in Japan. You needed to tap into that global talent base. And so that was also a key learning that I took away. It’s easy to, I think, have a simple view that we wish it hadn’t become so globalized because it becomes harder to control. And I understand that impulse, but I think you’d also have lost a lot of technological progress had it just been stuck within national boundaries.\n[00:10:44] Rene Haas: No, I think that’s completely right and you stated very well, the sheer complexity of the shrinking of the transistors and the pace at which we were shrinking them required global innovation in terms of contributing to all that. And whether it was ASML or applied materials or Tokyo Electron, you needed companies across the planet and the globe. In your research, what I remember going back down history lane here, and I was again, the TI in the eighties and at that time, Japan Inc. was really starting to become hugely influential. When I was at TI, TI was the number one semiconductor company in the world by revenue. By the time I left, I think it was Toshiba, NEC, and Hitachi that were the number one, two, and three. This is before Intel started to catch momentum. Why did Japan lose the magic? There was a time where the US was looking at all kinds of tariffs and restrictions and anti-dumping with the Japanese. Why do you think the Japanese lost the recipe?\n[00:11:42] Chris Miller: You know, I think there were two challenges that Japan faced in the 1980s that didn’t really become visible until the end of the decade or even the early 1990s. And the first was that many of the key Japanese firms, especially the big conglomerates, were making investment decisions based less on profitability and more on market share. And so if you measure by revenue, certainly it’s true, they were among the largest in terms of revenue. If you measure by profitability, that wasn’t always the case. And the fact that they were these big conglomerates that were closely tied with the banks that were funding their capital expansion plans meant that they didn’t face the same market pressures as US firms, which seemed like an asset and was an asset in terms of market share, but wasn’t an asset in terms of profitability. And so the moment Japanese banks started pulling back and companies had to look towards capital markets to fund themselves, they realized that they weren’t actually profitable enough to raise money in capital markets. So that was something that was a surprising vulnerability relative to what everyone thought it was in the 1980s. So that was something that was a surprising vulnerability relative to what everyone thought it was in the 1980s. So that was one reason. The second reason was that Japanese semiconductor firms were generally, especially the big conglomerates, because they were vertically integrated to a much greater degree, they were more inward looking. And again, I think that seemed like an asset at times, but it ended up being a vulnerability because they were less in tune to the ways that technology was changing. And you mentioned Intel, which really was able to capitalize on the emergence of the PC years ahead of any Japanese competitors, because they were looking at a broader ecosystem than the Japanese firms were looking at.\n[00:13:12] Rene Haas: Yeah, I know. I feel like my tombstone is full of experiences of companies that were going through. Then I was with NEC Semiconductor during the middle of 1990s. And to your point, I think that’s exactly what hurt these companies was the vertical integration and insular viewpoint. Because when, when the internet in quote happened and suddenly the world was flat and everything was open. Suddenly it was very, very difficult for the Japanese to move quickly. And, obviously then as your point to both the combination of the PC and the internet, suddenly the world had completely changed. And then we kind of bridging onto that, should nations be very, very prescriptive in terms of taking care of local manufacturing? There’s an Intel question there, obviously relative to the US, but it’s even more broadly, whether it’s automobiles or other critical industries. Do you think semiconductors, when you look at their importance and criticality, that policy needs to be shaped, there’s CHIPS Act, but maybe even more broadly, something even more comprehensive?\n[00:14:07] Chris Miller: So I think if you go back to where we started the conversation about the benefits of having internationally integrated supply chains, that illustrates the risks of being solely focused on a national manufacturing base. Now, you know, if you’re the United States, you’re the world’s largest economy. And so you’ve got the most scope, I think, to try to focus on a manufacturing base that’s domestic relative to smaller countries. But even still, I think there are real, certainly costs and also risks involved of focusing solely on domestic manufacturing. I think for, you know, certain government applications, it’s understandable governments want that, but that’s a small share of the market, obviously. And, and that’s, you know, why I think, I do give some credit to some of the policymakers in places like the US and Japan and Europe, who have been trying on the one hand to build up manufacturing in general in Western countries, but also not solely focused on their own country and still recognizing the importance of components and materials, et cetera, being traded between countries. I don’t think any of them are solely focused on their own manufacturing base and not recognizing kind of the importance of these broader international linkages. But I do think it’s a constant challenge to balance on the one hand, the political impulse to have more at home, and on the other hand, the industry impulse to let’s be as efficient as possible. And there are complex balances to be struck there.\n[00:15:31] Rene Haas: Do you think governments understand it well? I mean, obviously we’re in the midst of a transition here in our own government, but I think you raise a really important point because on one level, people can look at CHIPS Act, for example, and say, I’m just going to give money to people or grants to who are end quote manufacturing inside the United States. But to your point, it’s just one small piece of a gigantic value chain, whether it’s equipment, whether it’s packaging, the wafers are just a small piece. Do you think that’s well enough understood, the broadness of the problem?\n[00:16:02] Chris Miller: Well, that’s a good question. Yeah. Yeah. It’s a challenge, I think. You know, it is a challenge with regard to any industry, the government’s trying to understand, industry will always understand industry better. I think in the case of the semiconductor industry, especially in the United States, but I think it’s true across advanced economies, there had been much less interaction between industry, the semiconductor industry and government over the prior 10 or 15 years than over the last five years. And so there’d been a whole generation of folks in government who hadn’t really engaged with the semiconductor industry. And I think there’s been a lot of learning that’s been done over the last five or so years in the US and Japan and Europe about what the supply chain looks like, who the major players are, what their needs and requirements are. Certainly there’s still a major gap between what the typical person in government and what the typically person in industry knows that’s inevitable. But yes, there’s been lots of learning and studying that’s been undertaken the past half decade or so.\n[00:17:00] Rene Haas: Have you got it, I know that when I met with folks in Washington, when I would just do our rounds with our team, they would ask questions about our industry. And I would quote your book. I would say, “Look, if you want, if you want, a primer on learning how this industry works, go pick up Chris Miller’s book.” Have you been inundated with requests for, “hey, teach me more about how this industry works” from government, both in the US and abroad, I would say, because the book is a global, it’s a global industry in the book obviously has global impacts.\n[00:17:26] Chris Miller: Yeah, I think there’s been a lot of interest in both US and other governments and also I think the other key player here is the media, which plays a big role in educating the public and also educating government about how the industry works. And I think in the media as well, outside of specific tech-focused publications, there’s been a fair number of journalists who find themselves having to write a lot more about this semiconductor industry and how we had to learn a lot over the past couple of years about how it actually works.\n[00:17:52] Rene Haas: There was a period where the semiconductor industry was not considered the most alluring sector to be talking about, let alone writing about. Why do you think that was?\n[00:18:00] Chris Miller: You know, I think there were a couple of dynamics there. One was the rise of big software firms in the 90s, 2000s, 2010s, which were, of course, using a whole lot of semiconductors, but the public perception was that it was all about software or all about the consumer internet driving technological progress. And there’s, you know, a degree of truth to that. I do think that the fact that if you think of the big tech companies that emerged in the 2000s and 2010s, they were largely software focused. That shifted how the public in general viewed the tech sector. And so Silicon Valley, which of course was named after silicon, I came to be associated with social media as a result of that. I think that that has changed the last couple of years partly due to the supply chain dynamics, partly due to the politics, but also I think due to the fact that there has been a recognition that actually over the last couple of years, and I think looking forward into the future as well, it’s going to be advances in the hardware that will be just as important as advances in the software, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence. And I think the public perception of that has begun to shift in the last couple of years.\n[00:19:09] Rene Haas: Yeah, I think so. It’s, it’s nice to see one of the largest market cap companies in the world being a company that’s in our sector and now you have Broadcom in the trillion dollar club. I know that when we were having to explain, you know, post/during the NVIDIA transaction, and then as we were going public, what does Arm do exactly? It’s to your point. It’s all that software has to run on something. I want to talk a little bit about China. Obviously there’s a lot we could cover on that topic, but you know, in your book and subsequently afterwards, you were referring to just end quote, how far behind China might be in terms of catching up with Western technologies, whether that’s around their internal capability to build EUV machines and, or having the fabs being able to catch up to where the leading edge nodes are with a TSMC or Samsung or Intel, whatnot. If you think about when you wrote the book and where things are now, is China catching up? Are they about where they were when you wrote the book? Or have they fallen behind?\n[00:20:07] Chris Miller: Well, I think it’s a, it’s a complex question to answer because it depends what exactly you want to measure. And of course if you measure progress in design capabilities versus fabrication capabilities versus the tools themselves, you get different answers. There’s two ways that I think I look at this that we’ve got pretty good data on. You know, the first would be what’s the most advanced fabrication capability in Taiwan versus in China. And you know, there, I think we saw last year, SMIC rolled out relatively high volume manufacturing of their 7-9 meter capability, which we saw TSMC do about five years previously. So that’s a ballpark five year gap and you can debate around the margin, but I think that’s pretty good data. And you can actually track that gap historically, and what you find is that over the last 15 or so years, it’s been around steady, steady around five years that every year there’s advances at SMIC, TSMC and the gap is pretty standardized over time. So there, I think there hasn’t been a major change in one direction or the other. I think the other interesting place to look is when it comes to semiconductor manufacturing equipment. And there, you know, again, you can debate how best to interpret the data. But if you zoom into lithography tools, which has been one of the key areas of focus. You know, what you find is that China’s imports of foreign lithography equipment are actually at record highs right now, which, you know, doesn’t suggest a rapid degree of domestication. I think for some of the older, less capable lithography tools, there is some domestication happening, but at a pretty slow rate. And so there too, there’s a gap that remains. I think if you look at other spheres, you get different answers. Design, for example, there’s obviously very capable chip designers in China. There’s been some domestication of some of the chemicals and materials, but I guess the places where we’ve got the most visibility into you know, full like unlike comparisons between China and Taiwan, for example that gap remains broadly unchanged.\n[00:22:08] Rene Haas: Is it EUV and the mirrors associated with it? Do you think that is, kind of, if you look at the one critical component of the semiconductor value chain and say, gosh, China’s just not making head roads in terms of closing the gap. Is it EUV primarily, or do you think there’s other pieces of the value chain?\n[00:22:23] Chris Miller: You know, I think EUV is certainly the hardest single thing to replicate. The fact that it took ASML three decades and many billions of dollars to first develop illustrates just the scale of the challenge there. But I also think that that’s just one of many tools you need and there’s many precise chemicals you need to manufacture semiconductors, and so there’s a lot of different units that make it so hard. And if you were to solve the EUV problem, you’d still have many other challenges you’d have to work out, even though EUV is the biggest of the challenges in my view. And so I think, you know, it’s worth tracking really closely, what evidence can we see of competitors to ASML coming online. I think right now, not much evidence that that’s making progress, but of course, you know, that could change in the future. And that will be worth tracking closely.\n[00:23:12] Rene Haas: Now, I know you said you’re a historian, not a technologist, but you know a lot about our industry. You’ve talked to a lot of people and you’ve done an amazing amount of research. Are there new areas of technology that you find that could be very interesting, whether it’s around photonics, different materials, quantum. With the advent of AI, are there areas that you have bumped into from a technology space that you’ve looked at and say, “Hey, now this, in the next 5 to 10 years could be incredibly interesting and compelling in terms of changing how products are designed and developed”?\n[00:23:41] Chris Miller: You know, I think the AI boom is simultaneously very good for the existing structure of the industry because big customers are spending huge sums buying as many high end chips as possible. But the fact that they’re spending huge sums also creates a very big incentive to create new technologies that can do the same for cheaper. I think there’s lots of work being done on how within the existing paradigm can you economize on different facets, certainly photonic interconnects being an area of great focus right now. I don’t know about photonic integrated circuits themselves and their maturation. I think quantum computing is a place where, you know, there’s been great optimism about quantum computing for a long time. And it’s, I think, had cycles of optimism and pessimism. I guess I’m struck by the number of people working on quantum computing capabilities that they envision will integrate seamlessly into classical computing. And so rather than sort of a trade off, you’re going to have quantum and not use as much classical, you’re actually going to use both, I think is a way a lot of people now see them developing. And so, that’s actually not a bad thing for the semiconductor industry. It could be a good thing if you open up entire new capabilities and as a result demand more classical chips, as well as whatever quantum capabilities that we’re able to develop. And so when I kind of look forward, it seems to me that we’re still going to need very large volumes of as many high end processors we can make, even if quantum proves as a capable as the most bullish estimates suggest.\n[00:25:04] Rene Haas: Yeah, it feels that way at our company. We view it as more likely a hybrid type of solution where you’ve got kind of classic compute working with a quantum machine that could do acceleration of such, But it is an incredibly fascinating time as far as where that all is headed. Are you surprised again, I think your book came out and was it ‘22?\n[00:25:20] Chris Miller: That’s right.\n[00:25:21] Rene Haas: Yeah. So Chat GPT had maybe not had its lightning rod moment. But two, three years later, are you surprised at the velocity of which we’re seeing all of this innovation taking place with AI workloads, whether it’s again around training or inference or reasoning models, et cetera, et cetera.\n[00:25:36] Chris Miller: You know, I think, I think everyone’s surprised. I think it’s been an extraordinary two and a half years since the Chat GPT moment now. You know, I look back to when I wrote the book and I had a chapter on NVIDIA looking in particular at NVIDIA’s AI efforts. I had not a full chapter, but a fair bit on Google and its TPUs, but I could never have predicted just the speed at which both innovation has happened, but also a recognition that you can pretty quickly turn this innovation into real products. I think that’s been the surprise. And so the fact that all of the world’s big tech companies from Microsoft to Meta and across the board are now rapidly increasing their spending on data centers, which means on semiconductors. That’s a surprise to them. It was surprised to most of the chip industry. It was a surprise to me too.\n[00:26:25] Rene Haas: Are you an AI optimist or, or pessimist or somewhere, somewhere in the middle?\n[00:26:29] Chris Miller: Well, I think I’m broadly an optimist. I mean, I think we collectively have a challenge in making sure all of the investment that’s being undertaken leads to products that are monetizable and economically value additive. Whenever you’ve got this big surge of investment, there’s always some uncertainty. Will we have the business models to justify it in the long run? And so that’s, you know, a task that I think technology companies will have to prove out over the next couple of years, but it seems to me just given the rate of improvement over the last two and a half years since Chat GPT, there’s going to be a whole range of applications that we’re just beginning to get our heads around. I mean, I like the analogy of going back to the internet. You know, if we’re in like 1995, Google had yet to be founded, social media as a concept didn’t exist. And so I think we’ve got a long runway of turning new technologies into new products.\n[00:27:21] Rene Haas: I think, yeah, I use that a lot myself, which I think is a very good parallel. And the internet in many ways created a lot of new jobs and opportunities and eliminated some to some extent, as all major technological innovations do. Do you have a perspective on that as a story and watching this closely in terms of, “hey, this time it’s different,” or “no, it’s going to look just like it’s always look for these type of things”?\n[00:27:47] Chris Miller: You know, one of the very early computer researchers in the 1950s, a gentleman named Licklider or Lick as he was known to his friends, he worked for DARPA and played a big role in funding a lot of the early computer projects. And he wrote a paper in the mid fifties that laid out how he spent most of his day. And he estimated that he spent, very smart guy, but he spent 85 to 90 percent of his day, he estimated, on intellectual drudgery, things that ought to have been automated, but we’re not automatable. And I reread that paper recently. And I asked myself what share of my day is spent on things that I wish was easily automated. And I think it’s not 85 percent, but it’s still shockingly high. And so, I think most knowledge workers are actually going to embrace automating more of the stuff that now is impossible to automate, but they would actually greatly benefit from automating. And I think, you know, we easily forget that in the early days of the PC revolution programs like VisiCalc, the early version of Excel, were, when they were first brought to market in the late seventies and early eighties were seen to be catastrophic for the accounting industry because you no longer have people running the books manually. And in fact, the accounting profession has survived and thrived despite automation that was brought to them. And I think that’s the right analogy for AI. We’re gonna have lots of applications and lots of different professions, but on net, it’s going to make most of these professions much more pleasant because the not fun part of the job will be automated and the interesting and the fun part of the jobs will largely be maintained.\n[00:29:11] Rene Haas: Yeah, that’s a good way to look at it. It’s a bit of the way I tend to think about it too at times where if I look about our industry, semiconductors, and you made a great point in terms of as the chips became more and more complex, they had to be outsourced to other parts of the world for manufacturing. As the designs become more and more complex, you spend far less time on invention, and more and more time just figuring out does this thing work and how do I verify it and how do I validate it? And bug fixes and verification is actually the lion’s share of what it takes to develop intellectual property and or chips. And if AI can help with the drudgery of that I think it’s going to be a good thing. I promise not to get too much into the politics of the new administration and such. But as you go into thinking about the new administration and, and how the world’s going to look like for semiconductors, do you think it will be a better time in terms of, the friction will get less in terms of the globalization of semiconductors, including China, or do you think we might be in for a bumpy four years?\n[00:30:07] Chris Miller: You know, I think there’ll be a lot of continuity actually between the incoming administration and the Biden administration in large part, because what the Biden administration did had a lot of continuity with the first Trump administration. When you look at efforts to promote domestic manufacturing to the CHIPS Act, that was legislation that first emerged in Congress under the Trump administration. And I think there’ll be continuity broadly there. Maybe some changes are around the margin, but I think, you know, that’s a bipartisan issue in Congress for sure. I think also on the restrictions on technology transfer to China and to other countries, I think those are going to largely persist as well. Maybe some change around the margin, but you know, there are two, if you look in Congress, you’ve got Republicans and Democrats broadly supportive. So, you know, certainly is there going to be scope for zigzagging and scope for tweaks? No doubt. Does every president want to rebrand policies as their own policy rather than repetition of their predecessors? No doubt. But I think when you zoom out, I think there will be a lot of continuity. I think the one place where maybe we’re going to see a bit of change is on the question of trade policy and tariffs, where, you know, on the one hand, we did see the Biden administration impose new tariffs on semiconductors imported from China to the US, but I think President-Elect Trump has talked a lot more about making tariffs a central pillar of his trade policy. And so we’ll see, you know, over what time horizon at what scale, but I do think I expect more tariffs, which will certainly impact any industry that’s as globally integrated as the semiconductor industry.\n[00:31:36] Rene Haas: It’s going to be exciting for sure. Is there another book in the works?\n[00:31:39] Chris Miller: You know what, I’m spending so much time just tracking everything that’s changing in the semiconductor industry, I’ve got no time for a new book. I hope to dive into one soon, but nothing to announce yet.\n[00:31:50] Rene Haas: Got it. Cool. Chris, thank you very much for spending time with us.\n[00:31:53] Chris Miller: Hey, thank you.

Former Marine Corps, served in the Middle East, if I’m correct. Served in Congress. Now, you’re head of defense at Palantir. How does that happen?\n<Mike>[1:04]\nContingency, happenstance, luck? No, I’m from Green Bay, Wisconsin, originally, but I think I always had a fascination with the world outside of Wisconsin and outside of the United States. So when I went to college, I knew I wanted to study international relations, then was working at a think tank the summer after my sophomore year in the U.K. and I got assigned to this project studying terrorist targeting methods. And we had just invaded Iraq the year prior – this was 2004 – and I became fascinated by the Middle East. I became fascinated by our response to 9/11. So I went back to Princeton. I changed my major so I could learn Arabic, which was a bad decision as a junior because you had to go to class every morning at 9 a.m. But I loved it. And that led me to think about, okay, what would I do with these language and regional skills and the military – I don’t come from a military family – jumped out at me and I saw it as an opportunity not only to scratch that intellectual itch, but serve my country, pay back a debt I felt I owed. And I felt like I didn’t want to be sitting on the sidelines while the country was at war and also test myself physically, mentally in terms of my leadership. And it was just kind of that – I didn’t know anywhere else where I could have that intense crucible and, as a 21, 22 year old, be in charge of, you know, 50-ish Marines, I wanted that leadership challenge. And so the Marine Corps was just a great fit for me. The Marine Corps is a great program for people who aren’t at ROTC or don’t come from a, you know – I didn’t come from a military family, as I said before, so it was just, it really jumped out to me. So, a circuitous path that led me to join the Marine Corps, which is one of the better decisions I’ve made in my life.\n<Rene>[2:47]\nSo I want to find out also about Congress and Palantir, but let’s – let me talk about the Marine Corps for a little bit. Did you do Parris Island?\n<Mike>[2:54]\nNo, so if you’re an officer, you go through Quantico. And I went into a specialty called Counterintelligence, Human Intelligence, and did another specialty school after that deployed right out of school to Iraq. And they did two back to back deployments. But the usual journey or that I mean, the journey for an officer in the Marine Corps is to go through Quantico.\n<Rene>[3:17]\nSo Quantico, how many folks – I’m sorry. I’m now, I’m just so fascinated with this piece here. How many folks get through it? Do some people drop out?\n<Mike>[3:26]\nYeah. Yeah. In officer candidate school is usually where the most attrition happens. I forget the attrition rates, but it’s tough that the initial assessment, a lot of people get injured. And then there’s less attrition once you get to the basic school, but some people do drop out and they’re really just kind of screening you to see if you have what it takes to be a Marine Corps officer intellectually, physically, the physical standards are very high. I think that is one thing that distinguishes the Marine Corps. We tend to set a pretty high bar physically in terms of the physical fitness test. But I loved it.\n<Rene>[3:58]\nAnd you were what, your mid-twenties at this time or how old were you?\n<Mike>[4:02]\nYeah, probably 21 – yeah, 20. I was 20 or 21 when I went to officer candidate school the summer after my junior year of college and then 22 because I went right after – I graduated from college, I got commissioned as an officer the day I graduated. I then had about four months before I had to report to Quantico for the basic school. So I went up to Middlebury and did their Arabic immersion program. Middlebury has a phenomenal language program. You take a language pledge where you’re only allowed to speak that language, and really you cram two years worth of coursework into a few months. And so I was able to really hone my Arabic prior to reporting to Quantico, which then served me well when I deployed, because as a human intelligence officer, I was doing a lot of interrogations, I was doing a lot of source operations. So being able to communicate directly in the language, even though I kind of spoke more of a stilted, formal version of Arabic, what’s called the Fuṣḥā. I didn’t speak the local dialect or the Amiyah. It still served me well and allowed me to go places and do things that some other people weren’t able to do.\n<Rene>[5:02]\nI feel incredibly inferior based upon – at 21, I was just hoping to get out of electrical engineering university and get a job for that. That’s unbelievable. How did you get into politics?\n<Mike>[5:12]\nSo, a long story short, Marine Corps for seven years. Couple of deployments. Got to work for H.R. McMaster, General Petraeus, a little bit of a stint of tours in the intelligence community. I was a Senate staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Middle East guy, for two years. I then moved back to Wisconsin to be the national security adviser on a presidential campaign when our governor, Scott Walker, ran for president, which was a phenomenal experience, even though he didn’t win that campaign. That was in 2016. And so I was back home in Wisconsin, and I knew – I was actually trying to pivot to a private sector career. I’d use my G.I. Bill to get my Ph.D. in international relations. And so I really – the conception of the career I had in mind was I would do private sector and I would teach as kind of a side hustle and a way to scratch my academic itch. Then my congressman unexpectedly retired, a great guy named Reid Ribble. And because I had just been on a presidential campaign going around the state and the country, talking to people that were engaged in politics about the future of foreign policy, some people in northeast Wisconsin asked me if I’d be interested in running, and it was very intimidating. It was not, I mean, I was not – I don’t, I don’t have any political lineage. I’d never really been in front of the camera before. I didn’t know anything about political fundraising. I was a national security policy guy. And so at first I thought, no way, I can’t do this. But then I thought, you know, here I am criticizing the direction of U.S. foreign policy, criticizing Congress. I felt like – I was 31 or 32, why not step up. So I got into the race. I beat a long time state senator and some others in a primary and then won what was a very contested general. My district used to be a very competitive district and then it became very Republican. And so it was kind of just right place, right time. And maybe to connect it to my Marine Corps experience, I did view it as an extension, a different way to serve the country and continue to serve focusing on the issues that I had focused on in the Marine Corps defense, Middle East, national security, but also just felt like this was another opportunity to throw myself into a crucible that was very uncomfortable for me. And I tend to think like every once in a while, every three or five years, you should really get outside your comfort zone. And that’s the only way you grow as a leader and as a thinker.\n<Rene>[7:35]\nOne of the things that folks have talked a lot about is leaders, are they born? Are they made? And I think of anyone who’s kind of gone through what the Marine Corps embodies to me is the quintessence of leadership, not to mention being on the battlefield. Your viewpoint on leaders: born, made? Can you teach it?\n<Mike>[8:00]\nI think they’re made, you know, recognizing everybody has different strengths and weaknesses and different gifts that are, in some sense, innate. By and large, I still think leaders are made, and I think the primary way in which you become a better leader is by failing a lot. I mean, it’s not like I emerged from Quantico as an impeccable Marine Corps leader. I made a ton of mistakes while I was deployed. I continue to make mistakes as a leader. I remember vividly one time I had a Marine who had what’s called a negligent discharge, which is when you fire your weapon accidentally, it’s not a good thing to do, particularly in the Marine Corps. And it caused a lot of drama with our local unit. And my initial response was to try and like make sure there was as little fallout as possible, i.e. nothing that could jeopardize our unit and my own career, quite frankly. And then I had a boss who was an amazing guy, and he basically took responsibility for the whole thing. He said it was my responsibility to get these Marines ready for deployment. Don’t punish the Marine, punish me. And that was like a jaw dropping moment when I realized that – what it means to be a leader, like you have to take ownership of those under your command and you have to put their welfare ahead of your own. And that was a lesson I had to learn the hard way. And I was quite ashamed of myself, quite frankly. And so it’s a continuous journey. But I do think leaders are made. Final thing I’d say, Rene, is I think sometimes people have like a Hollywood conception of leadership in their mind, particularly when they go into the Marine Corps. I think the challenge is adapting timeless principles of leadership to your own unique personality. Like I would never be the like, you know, hardcore drill sergeant type. That’s just not my personality. I’m a bit more collaborative, professorial. And so I had to adapt kind of the Marine Corps vision of leadership to my own unique personality and innate traits, if that makes sense.\n<Rene>[9:54]\nTotally. And I agree with you. I think leaders are made. There are qualities we’re all born with. But we also have the ability to adapt and be made and learn, etc., etc.. And one of the things that I talk about a lot with our company is around resiliency and making mistakes and the fact that you just can’t learn and develop and get to that next level without making mistakes. Now, going into your commentary about making mistakes and learning: you served in Iraq. How do you recover from mistakes when you’re actually in combat? That seems to be a whole different level.\n<Mike>[10:29]\nWell, listen, I mean, I was an intelligence officer, so I’m not trying to pretend like I was some, you know, big combat hero or anything like that. And by and large, I was the beneficiary of the sacrifices that were made far earlier in the surge, you know, and we lost a lot of good Marines in western Al Anbar province. But by the end of my second deployment, I mean, we were walking around, you know, without our body armor. It had largely shifted to more of a like, a humanitarian in some sense, a humanitarian and civil society building mission. But yeah, yeah, there’s certainly, it’s still a life or death enterprise, and that can be hard for certain people to deal with. But that’s where I think, you know, having men and women to your left and your right that you trust really building a shared culture and ethos. I think the Marine Corps does that better than maybe any other organization on earth, right, everyone, you know, rich, poor, black, white, men, women, if you make it through the basic Marine Corps crucible, you’re Marine. Everybody bleeds green, as the saying goes. And so it’s only by having a strong team around you that you can cope with failure. And to the point about mistakes. My sort of personal mantra in life is just to make original mistakes. My only goal is to not be making the same mistakes over and over again. And I try to encourage my subordinates to make original mistakes and give them enough of a leash where they don’t feel like they’re going to get punished for taking intelligent risks.\n<Rene>[11:45]\nAbsolutely. I think about my career and the most growth I’ve ever had has been making mistakes and the learnings. So now you’re at Palantir. Amazing company. Alex Karp, fantastic CEO. Palantir has been on fire. Before I ask you about the transition. I’m not sure how many of the folks who are listening to this know exactly what Palantir does. So maybe tell us, what does Palantir do and what was the inspiration to kind of go from public service to joining them?\n<Mike>[12:13]\nI mean, the inspiration was I have been aware of Palantir’s work for a while. It had started to be deployed into the Marine Corps as I was getting out of the fleet and I had some friends that had used it very early on and were blown away. I mean, If you think about like what an intelligence officer in the Marine Corps does, right? In my case, you collect information from humans. You sort of write that up into a report. You can plot certain information on a map. You brief things on PowerPoint slides. All of this is very time intensive and involves a lot of humans in the loop. It was very like analog, even back then. So along comes a piece of software that allows you to automate that process and speed up your decision making, make sense of disparate sources of data, and now use satellite imagery and take a process that used to involve hundreds of human beings and thousands of hours and distill it down into, you know, one human being and make it a matter of minutes. I mean, you can see the benefits in terms of creating decision advantage. And so today on the battlefield Palantir software operationalizes AI and allows our fighters to make sense of the battlefield, see bad guys, target more precisely. And then in the boardroom, on the commercial side of our business, Palantir’s software – basically the way I like to think about it is anywhere in a business where information is instantiated on a whiteboard or in an Excel spreadsheet or in the mind of a human being, you can now embed that into our core product, which is called Foundry, and then use AI to automate various processes and just move faster than your competitors and save money in the process.\n<Rene>[13:48]\nTwo questions. So first off, Palantir, I think externally has a brand that people are associating with defense. And as you said, you guys use it in the military. But do you think the commercial opportunity for Palantir is larger? It feels like it should be just given the problems that you described and the scale of data that exists in a commercial sector.\n<Mike>[14:10]\nWell, Palantir, you know, it’s unique. It certainly got its start in the wake of 9/11 and looking at the failures that led up to 9/11 and believing strongly that they could have been prevented with a better use of technology and allowing decision makers to better connect the dots in terms of what our enemies were doing. But then it evolved and in the last five years, the commercial business has really taken off. And now we’re in this unique position where we have a thriving commercial business and a thriving government business. But really what intrigues me the most is the opportunity to take the lessons learned from both sides of the business and cross-pollinate them. Right, because there’s certain insights we have because we’re working with warfighters in the Pentagon, helping them make sense of the battlespace or helping them, like, digitize a process that used to be a matter of PowerPoint slides that we can apply to the commercial business and vice versa. The Marine Corps is launching a big barracks modernization initiative right now. I see an opportunity to take some of our insights in the construction field, in the commercial world and apply it directly to the defense business and help our military automate the so-called tail – that’s all the supporting establishment – and use those saved resources to sharpen the tooth – that’s the things at the tip of the spear, that’s the war fighters, that’s the weapons that directly enhance our lethality and increase near-term deterrence. So that’s the opportunity I see from both a business and a national security perspective. And increasingly, if you look at the defense industrial base, it used to be the case that most of our biggest defense companies had thriving commercial businesses and would actually subsidize their own R&D and not ask the U.S. taxpayer to do it. Because the defense industrial base has grown smaller and ossified, it is increasingly rare to see a company like that that has both thriving commercial and defense work. And so I think this is the model we need to return to. And I think that’s sort of the unique position Palantir is in right now. And hopefully we can harvest those commercial insights in order to better serve the warfighter going forward.\n<Rene>[16:08]\nDo we need more Palantirs from the perspective of an interesting comment you just made, because I started my career 100 years ago at TI, and this is 1980s. Ronald Reagan’s our president, Star Wars. We had a huge semiconductor effort that was all about doing work for Patriot missiles and everything that was really during the Cold War. And to your point, TI, at that time largest semiconductor company in the world, had a gigantic defense semiconductor business. And as you said, that’s kind of gone by the wayside. Do we need more companies doing the kind of work Palantir does – not directly in your competition, but to your point of a thriving business that helps them on the defense side? Because I wonder, how can government keep up without it?\n<Mike>[16:52]\nThat’s right. Well, we should obviously have no competitors. There should be no – I’m just joking. Yes, every business’s dream.\n<Rene>\nNow that you’re out of politics, you can say that. Yeah.\n<Mike>[17:00]\nYeah, exactly. Exactly. I would put it this way, I think we need more non-traditionals to be, to get into the government space to cross the so-called valley of death that Palantir has spent the last two decades and spent billions of dollars doing. It is far too hard for a company who wants to help the government and help the Defense Department or the intelligence community to do so. Because the Defense Department is not an easy customer. It’s part of the reason why we launched our FedStart program to allow the younger and non-traditional tech startups, which still face these incredible barrier entries to get into the defense ecosystem and not have to do that journey that Palantir did. And so I think if we do that, we can have a defense ecosystem that isn’t dominated by a small number of defense primes, but it’s far healthier where the primes are working with non-traditionals. But where the rubber meets the road is just how the Pentagon buys things and how it spends money. And we’re still struggling with this problem of – we tend to sprinkle out, you know, money for non-traditionals in innovation and dilute in small grants, as opposed to DOD making big bets on non-traditional companies. And I think fixing that, combining that with a greater tolerance for what’s called multi-year appropriation so you can provide some predictability to companies that are trying to build things for the Defense Department, is the path forward. all of this redounds to making sure we have the best and brightest human beings in these companies willing to work with the Defense Department. That’s another way where we can build a bridge between Silicon Valley and the defense and the technology industry and the core national security community.\n<Rene>[18:44]\nYeah, makes sense. And it’s a good segue into this question, which I think you are probably in a very unique position to have a perspective on now that you are in the private sector, but obviously served our country in Congress. And this is around AI, and should there be a national policy around AI? And when I say national policy, it’s – obviously that’s an umbrella term for the government having a much higher involvement in terms of security, safety policies, procedure guidelines, etc., etc. What’s your view on that?\n<Mike>[19:18]\nWell, in one sense, I’m not sure it makes sense to talk about a national AI policy per se, because AI is not a single piece of technology. It’s a cluster of technologies. And the risks and opportunities are different depending on what specific aspect or what specific cluster you’re talking about. So I think the good part of the latest executive order, which is the closest we have to a national policy, is that it does recognize that sector-based approach and defers to the various sectors in terms of drawing on their sectoral proficiencies to cultivate AI development and manage the risks. But the problem is that we haven’t put any real investment behind that policy. So put differently, I think the most important national policy we can have where the federal government has a clear and unique role with private sector input, is for the Defense Department to spend more money on responsible AI use. Right now I think the numbers that the Defense Department spends about 0.2% of its budget on i.e. increasing that amount to just 1% or 8.42 billion. To support our troops with the most advanced form of software available from commercial providers would have an outsize impact on our defense and our deterrence capabilities. And so that to me is one area where we do need more national involvement. Another is having a policy that forces the Defense Department and other agencies to adhere to existing law. There’s a commercial preference embedded into existing law so that the government doesn’t try to build software and AI tools itself, and yet this law goes violated on an almost daily basis and we waste a lot of money on government off the shelf solutions when we should be seeking to buy commercial off the shelf solutions. So there’s a series of things I think we can do in the pure defense space that amount to a national policy and balance the sort of need to go fast and innovate with the legitimate concerns about the safe and responsible deployment of AI, if that makes sense.\n<Rene>[21:24]\nMakes sense. But should it be regulated? Should large language models be regulated and tested before they’re available for the consumer, for example?\n<Mike>[21:34]\nWell, I think the best way to ascertain what the right form of regulation is, is a field to learn or a test fix test approach. Right, you field AI with the end users and operators with workflows that are relevant to their missions. The models are then improved through iteration with operators in the field, and then you refine the systems as you extend it to larger groups over time. And in that journey you figure out what the right guardrails are. I think it would be the height of hubris to think that a few bureaucrats could sit in a room, even if next to them were the leading minds and private sector leaders when it comes to artificial intelligence and construct a perfect regulatory framework that still allows room for going fast, you need to approach it with that field to learn and test fix test approach.\n<Rene>[22:25]\nIn the private sector, when people talk about things they hate most about their jobs, they’ll say, I love the technology, I love the company, I love the people, but God, I hate the politics inside my job. You worked in a domain called politics. What did you like most about that role inside politics and what was something you look back and say, gosh, that was not fun to do.\n<Mike>[22:46]\nWell, the latter question is easier. The thing I hated most was fundraising. And I do think the fundamental dilemma, if you’re a member of Congress, is that you are having to do your job while also raise money to run for your job simultaneously. And in the house where you’re on a two year time horizon, that can be very difficult. Just carving out enough hours in your day to do responsible oversight, attend all your committee hearings, and then have to go across the street and raise money. I never enjoyed fundraising. I always found it weird, maybe because I have Catholic guilt, to ask people for money, and so not having to fundraise anymore has been a huge blessing in my life. So that was definitely the bad, the good. However, and I think I had the benefit of, I knew I never was going to make it a career. I believe in the model of a citizen legislator. I think that’s why I’m a proponent of term limits. I think members tend to stay too long and it should be a season of service. So that was very liberating for me. And so that gave me the freedom to really focus on the committee work. I was most passionate about the Armed Services Committee work, chairing the Cyberspace Solarium Commission and then ultimately chairing the Select Committee on China was profoundly rewarding. I love that. And then what do you do when you’re back in your district? Well, one, you go round to all the different businesses in your district and you just learn what people are making, what their daily lives are like. It has a way of helping you fall back in love with where you’re from. I didn’t fully appreciate it when I first ran and that was really rewarding. And you learn a ton or you help people solve problems, helping people get their VA benefits, helping them deal with the thorny immigration issue, helping them deal with weird government regulations. I mean, it’s sad that sometimes you have to call your congressman to get those issues fixed. But if you’re the congressman and you can really help someone, that’s a big deal and that’s super rewarding. So I love that. The final thing I’d say, Rene, which I think you’ll appreciate, is, you know, it’s really hard to build a team in business in the public sector. So it took me a while to really get my office team and culture exactly how I wanted it. But in those final two years, I really felt like we had an incredible team. Everyone was kind of operating by commander’s intent. And our decision making was really fast. And that was really rewarding for me because you’re working with a lot of young people on the Hill, too, which is, it was just energizing. So I miss that team.\n<Rene>[25:05]\nYou’re an amazing speaker. When you went up and did a campaign speech in your district, prepared remarks or you just wing it?\n<Mike>[25:14]]\nYou know, the first four years, very prepared. I had never been in front of a camera. I was incredibly nervous the first time I did a local TV show, let alone going on a national news show. And so I would overprepare. I would often write my speeches out and I would memorize them. But then I would say I got comfortable doing everything extemporaneously and I went too far in the complacent direction of not preparing. And now I find myself having to remind myself that I need to prepare and that I’m a bit out of shape. I will say, however, I do think the one life hack or maybe two life hacks that have melded into one that have given me a competitive edge are that in the Marine Corps, I started up I started waking up really early and I would devote, you know, after I do my sort of Catholic thing in the morning, I would devote an hour just to writing. And I do think forcing myself to write out my thoughts, even if it didn’t result in a publishable Op-Ed or article or a talking points that I would use on TV, it’s still a discipline that I practice every single day and I think helps me communicate, because my view is that if you can’t write clearly, then you can’t think clearly and you certainly can’t speak clearly.\n<Rene>[26:28]\nYeah, that’s kind of how I do it. What I do is an outline of things and a flow that I want to go. And when I’m doing a presentation, for example, I always drill on my team, don’t show me the slide I’m presenting, show me the next slide. So what the next slide does for me, it just gives me a context of the story I’m trying to tell and that there’s a continuum to it. Brett Favre, Aaron Rodgers, who do you take?\n<Mike>[26:52]\nBart Starr, number 15. Every Sunday, you see me wearing number 15, Bart Starr’s jersey.\n<Rene>[26:59]\nIt’s a great answer. A truly gifted politician. I give you two choices and you come up with a third. Would you ever run for president someday?\n<Mike>[27:08]\nGenuinely, I do not look in the mirror and think ‘one day I’m going to be president’. Like I am at core still that kind of, I think of myself as a national security professional, so I’d love to serve if the moment were right in a national security job, but there are no plans in my head for running for president one day. My wife is pregnant with twins. So we’re going to focus on having children and building out our family for a while before I get any political ideas. I’m trying to be you, Renee. I’m trying to learn how to be a leader in the private sector. So I’m on month two of this, so I’ve got a long journey ahead of me.\n<Rene>[27:45]\nOh, my gosh. I don’t know where to start there. Mike, thank you so much for giving us the time here. This was terrific.\n<Mike>[27:52]\nThank you, sir.\n<Rene>[28:00]\nWe’ll be back next month with more exclusive conversations and insights from the world of technology.

They dive into Jensen's journey, the future of AI, and how NVIDIA's unique culture of relentless innovation and ambition continues to push the boundaries of technology.\n[music comes in]\nRene:[0:00]\nWelcome to Tech Unheard, the podcast that takes you behind the scenes of the most exciting developments in technology. I’m Rene Haas, CEO of Arm. At Arm we’re shaping the future of computing with the industry’s most powerful and energy-efficient compute platform designed to unlock the full potential of AI. Our technology is at the core of innovation\nRene:[0:24]\nfor leading companies across the globe. In this podcast, I’ll be sitting down with some of the brightest minds in the industry to share insights, stories and vision for what lies ahead.\nRene:[0:34]\nToday, I have the privilege to speak with Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA. A true visionary, my former boss and a personal mentor of mine. We’re going to dive into his journey, the future of AI and how NVIDIA’s unique culture of relentless innovation and ambition continues to push the boundaries of technology. We sat down and met at NVIDIA’s headquarters in Santa Clara to talk.\n[music crescendos and then fades out]\nRene:[1:02]\nReady to go?\nJensen:[1:03]\nI was ready the moment I walked in.\nRene:[1:05]\nIt’s great to be back.\nJensen:[1:06]\nWell, thank you. Yeah, it’s great. It’s great to see you.\nRene:[1:08]\nIt’s great to be back here at NVIDIA. This building did not exist when I worked here many, many years ago.\nJensen:[1:14]\nHow many? How many years ago now? 20? (When you first started?)\nRene:[1:17]\nI started in 2006. I left in 2013.\nJensen:[1:21]\nYea, see? 20 years.\nRene:[1:22]\nYeah. 20 years ago. These buildings did not exist. It’s a, it’s a nice feeling to be back, though.\nFamiliar. Thanks for, thanks for spending the time.\nJensen:[1:27]\nThanks for having me.\nRene:[1:28]\nSo now that you’ve grown so large, one of things I’ve always been curious about, Jensen, with NVIDIA is hiring. The culture is one of a kind. The company does things in a one-of-a-kind way. How do you identify folks who are going to be successful inside NVIDIA?\nJensen:[1:42]\nWe’re not always successful in doing that. Look how you turned out. [laughter] That’s [laughter] it’s always a shot in the dark. I think that the interview process is not an excellent way to judge whether somebody is a good fit. I mean, obviously, everybody could pretend\nJensen:[2:02]\nto have a very constructive conversation. You could learn a lot from just watching YouTube on how to interview. And so, you know, the technical questions, of course, people\nJensen:[2:12]\neven share what NVIDIA technical questions are. And we try to be as rigorous and difficult as possible. But – but it’s hard. I think that my method is always I go back to reference checks, you know, and I ask them the questions that I was going to ask the candidate. And the reason for that is you could always make make for a great moment, but it’s hard\nJensen:[2:33]\nfor you to run away from your past. And so I think those are good. I like asking one in-depth question and just thinking about how they reason through it.\nJensen:[2:43]\nBut I think in the final analysis, NVIDIA has been successful for a lot of people. Our attrition rate’s very low, as you know. And and so it’s a really diverse environment with a lot of really interesting people in the background. And we have people from from just about every great company in the world and somehow, we’ve made them successful here. And so I\nJensen:[3:02]\nthink that that on the one hand, building a great company is about getting great people. On the other hand, building a great company is really about creating the conditions by which those people could do even better than they thought they\nJensen:[3:13]\ncould. And, you know, a lot of that has to do with being transparent about explaining what NVIDIA’s vision and strategy and what makes us work. As you know, I spent a lot of time doing that. And our company has always been known for its transparency about explaining what what challenges we have, what opportunities we have, what strategies\nJensen:[3:33]\nwe’re executing. And information is flowing fairly readily inside the company with respect to, you know, what is it the company’s strategies are. I always find that it’s strange\nJensen:[3:43]\nwhen companies have too many silos and, you know, need to know basis. I think obviously, you know, people don’t need to know what they don’t need to know. But the more that they know, the more they’re empowered to be able to make good decisions on our behalf. And so I try to err on the side of transparency. I try to err on the side of empowering people.\nJensen:[4:03]\nAnd as a result, you know, the company is one of the, I think we’re the smallest large company in the world.\nRene: For sure.\nJensen: You know, I think that’s just that comes with the the incredible productivity\nJensen:[4:13]\nof the people. And we have 30, 30,000 people or so maybe a little bit more than that now. And they’re making hundreds of decisions a day. And if all 30,000 of them are, you know, statistically moving in the direction, making decisions that are ambiguous decisions oftentimes, but they’re making it in the direction of of what is in the\nJensen:[4:33]\ncompany’s best interest long term. It adds up really fast.\nRene:[4:37]\nOne of the things that always amazed me is that– you know, back to that point–and again, I don’t know whether it was hiring the right people or self-selection, but by having senior leaders who are extremely comfortable with ambiguity and the fact that you would reach down into different layers, the organization, i.e. the project, is what’s most important.\nRene:[4:54]\nI just wondered how did that happen? Is it just something that as you grew the company and you had senior leaders who were aligned with your vision, that it grew up that way? Because it was just amazing that\nRene:[5:04]\nso many of the senior leaders here when I worked with NVIDIA, worked at NVIDIA, they were completely fine with the fact that you would just reach around and get the right people in the room to solve a problem.\nJensen:[5:14]\nWell, first I didn’t ask them, as you recall.\n<Rene>[5:17]\nI do recall.\nJensen:[5:18]\nAnd the reason for that is because you shouldn’t have to ask permission for something that is that obvious, you know. And so the reason why we said it that way is that NVIDIA was designed to be a full-stack computing company, we were designed to be a company that would build GPUs and CPUs and networking chips\nJensen:[5:38]\nand switches, and we would do architecture and design of chips and develop system software and create algorithms and even, you know, create solvers.\nJensen:[5:49]\nAnd so how would you organize such a thing where everything has to work together on the one hand, but you have to build it in parts on the other hand. [Rene: Yeah.] And so the way we solved the problem was, instead of having organizational silos, we thought of the organizations as a place where the leaders can groom people,\nJensen:[6:09]\ncreate conditions for them to succeed, be of service to them, to help them remove obstacles and such. But the mission; the mission is the boss, and it cuts across the whole company.\nJensen:[6:19]\nSo it can cut across systems and chips and networking chips and software and algorithms, and it can cut across all kinds of domains. And by organizing that way, we also created transparency, you know, all these silos became porous. And when organizations are porous, it tends to be better, you\nJensen:[6:39]\nknow, because you have a lot more people who are able to help you criticize it. You have a lot more people to help you prove it. And so I love this, the porosity of our company, if you\nJensen:[6:49]\nwill. I just love that everything is transparent and everybody’s helping me make it better. And,\nyou know, [Rene: Yep] it’s not like everything is in some kind of, you know, dark silo.\nRene:[6:59]\nYou almost acquired us, which would have been would’ve been fun. But you acquired Mellanox.\nJensen:[7:02]\nI know you’re still sad about it.\nRene:[7:04]\nI’m still sad. [laughter] Every day I cry a little bit, but. But I’m here.\nJensen:[7:08]\nThank you. [laughter] But you guys have done so well. You have done so well.\nRene:[7:11]\nBut you did acquire Mellanox, which has been not only an amazing acquisition in terms of your strategy, but it also just seems like seamlessly, to your point of a porous organization where the mission trumps everything… From the outside in it looks incredibly seamless in terms of execution. How did how did that happen? I mean, how did you make that so? I mean, M&A is so tough.\nJensen: It is tough\nRene: It is culturally very tough.\nJensen:[7:32]\nYeah, it is tough. Well, first of all, there are ten people, I think maybe more ten, 12 people on the Mellanox management team, the NVIDIA Israel management team that sits on E-staff. We have\nRene:[7:46]\nThat’s great. That makes a difference.\nJensen:[7:46]\narchitecture, we have research, we have software systems, the chips, we have nets and switches, we have NVLink switches now. We used to have just InfiniBand product line, but now we have a whole Ethernet product line. In the short time that we’ve been together, the product portfolio\nJensen:[8:07]\nof Mellanox, well, quadrupled and they’re integrated into every aspect of everything we do. If you look at the transformation and you recall\nJensen:[8:17]\nthe acquisition, our vision was that the unit of computing was no longer going to be, for example, a GPU, which is really a peripheral. Arm, helped us, in fact, quite importantly, to transition into a company that was building an SoC. And now remember what an SoC is, an SoC is basically\nJensen:[8:37]\na whole computer, whereas a discrete GPU is the last thing that comes up in the computer. The CPUs com up, the boot ROMs come up, the operating systems come\nJensen:[8:46]\nup, and eventually the GPU comes up. In the case of an SoC, you have to bring the whole thing up yourself. And so it caused NVIDIA to to evolve from being a algorithm company, which is really what a GPU company is to a computing company. That was our first entry and the SoC wasn’t easy for us in the beginning. We built some amazing\nJensen:[9:07]\nones now. And then the next evolution for us was building systems and DG X1 was our first. In fact, I’m still quite fond of of SHIELD,\nJensen:[9:16]\nwhich is our Android TV computer and I’m very fond of it because it was really NVIDIA’s first full system that we created and –\nRene:[9:26]\nThe learnings on SHIELD must have been amazing. Now looking back, because I remember when we started.\nJensen:[9:30]\nThat, yeah, it is still the most popular Android TV box that people –\nRene:[9:34]\nBack in the day. It was a PlayStation Xbox controller with a display and we were just think to ourselves, how do we do this?\nJensen:[9:40]\nYeah, it is still my favorite thing that NVIDIA has ever made.\nRene:[9:42]\nI completely forgot about that. Yeah.\nJensen:[9:44]\nThat’s really good.\nRene:[9:67]\nThat was a system.\nJensen:[9:48]\nYeah, I learned a lot.\nRene:[9:47]\nYeah.\nJensen:[9:49]\nI learned a lot. And to this day, we’re still maintaining the software.\nRene:[9:52]\nIt was utterly unobvious that there was a fit in the marketplace for this. And I remember folks inside the group suddenly having to source a whole set of components. [cross-talk]\nJensen:[10:04]\nExactly. It was my excuse to turn NVIDIA into a systems company and people will ask me, you know, the DGX1, which is the the computer that changed everything. Or, you know, how did that come about? Well, DGX1 one is just a very large SHIELD.\nRene:[10:18]\nVery large SHIELD. Yeah. Yeah.\nJensen:[10:20]\nAnd and so to to me, the fact that SHIELD was made out of plastic, and DGX1 weighs 600 pounds, you know, that transition wasn’t a big deal. The big deal was that we were now able to build systems and and then when we bought Mellanox, the big idea was that the computer was no longer going to be that node, but the computer\nJensen:[10:39]\nis going to be the entire data center, that the data center is going to be the unit of computing. And if you don’t, if you don’t design GPU, the CPU, the NIC, the\nJensen:[10:50]\nswitches, all of the transceivers, and connect everything together and be able to boot that system up, you know, from nothing and get everything all wired up. Get everything all running and distribute workloads across it. If you don’t do that, you’re really not going to understand what it means to build these AI superclusters and that transition,\nJensen:[11:09]\nthat vision was so clear that it was necessary for galvanizing the two teams. You know, in order to galvanize teams, you have to have a very clear\nJensen:[11:19]\nvision. And we had a very clear vision. And that vision was also very tangible because you could see it sitting right in front of you there, super cluster and got all the gear from both companies. And, and so the vision was clear and inspiring. It’s tangible or we have to make it tangible. As CEOs you have to make abstract things tangible.\nJensen:[11:41]\nAnd we went off and built it. And so anyways, I also think that their culture is great.\nRene:[11:46]\nYeah. And that clarity really helps. But going back to kind of the vision thing for a second, and there’s another thing that I do when I tell stories about the company. SHIELD a good example. CUDA in the early days, chasing oil and gas, is a good example where it’s completely unobvious.\nJensen:[11:57]\nPeople didn’t realize that. In fact, that was our first. Was first. Yeah that was.\nRene:[12:00]\nCompletely unobvious what the the real end quote killer app or end state is yet you have an incredible resiliency to experiment with ideas early and test them even though the market doesn’t either appear ready and or have the definition for it. What do you chalk that up to? Is that incredible intuition? Is that seeing around – [cross talk]\nJensen:[12:23]\nWe’ve had good intuition, you know, ten times in the company, as you know, and the benefit that that NVIDIA has is we are surrounded by extraordinary people. [Rene: Unquestionably. Yeah Unquestionably.] I mean, yeah. These are the finest computer scientists, the finest strategists and business people in the world. And they’re egoless and they want to do great things.\nJensen:[12:43]\nAnd and so I think that that one, we start with that. I think the second part is we’re good at intuition. I think we have a good intuition about\nJensen:[12:53]\nwhat problems need to be solved and how to get us from where we are today to becoming the company we want to be. And so I think our intuition’s good about what the what the various stepping stones are. And, you know, each one of the things that we did a lot of, I was asked, you know, why are we building SHIELD? I mean, what a waste of time. And I said, we’re going to be a systems company someday\nJensen:[13:13]\nand all these systems are going to be connected to cloud services. Why go break our pick on the largest systems? Why don’t we go do this one first? And if we can’t do this one, we’re not going to do\nJensen:[13:23]\nthe large one. And so to create the conditions where the company could go go learn some new skill, fail, but not not damage yourself, you know, and so.\nRene:[13:33]\nCan that only happen in companies where the leader is or was a founder? Because again, very, very few companies do what you just described, both in terms of being having clarity of vision, but also resiliency to continue to understand where to go. Is that – there’s been a lot written recently about founder mode versus manager mode, and obviously you’re a founder\nRene:[13:53]\nleading a company 30 years later. It goes without saying the amount of success you’ve seen. But can this only be done, what you described, by the founder leading the company?\nJensen:[14:03]\nI don’t think so. I think you’re doing great at Arm. You know, when I watch you do your work, I’m very proud of it.\nRene:[14:08]\nWell, I learned from you, which is not [Jensen: Appreciate that.]– which is being truthful.\nJensen:[14:12]\nYeah. And I love watching you do your work and it makes me happy. It brings me great joy and pride. I don’t think so. I think that it is true: you have to have great resilience and you have to have perseverance. And I describe it as pain and suffering, as, you know, [laughter] and\nRene:\nTeaching moments.\nJensen:[14:32]\nYou know, yeah, pain and pain and suffering is how you feel.\nRene: I felt it.\nJensen: And yeah, and in a lot of ways you have to get used to it. You have to get\nJensen:[14:42]\nused to the idea that there’s pain and suffering involved. And, you know, that the journey to success is not about one achievement led by another achievement and another achievement. It’s not like that. You know, there are big setbacks, sometimes there’s embarrassing moments, you know, when you’re a CEO and and you haven’t enjoyed any of that yet. But\nRene:[15:02]\nIt’ll happen.\nJensen:[15:03]\nWell I hope it happens, because it will be good for you. But, you know, all those moments are, I don’t know what I learned from it, but it made me stronger, you know, and I know I could survive it. I know I didn’t like it at the time. But when I look back on it, those are the moments where you\nRene: That’s where you grow.\nJensen:[15:23]\nThat’s right. You are most proud of yourself. You’re most proud of your company and that you\nsurvived it. And so, so I think the company- our company is strong because we have\nJensen:[15:35]\nlots of stories like that. You know, in the halls of this company are just are just filled with extraordinary stories of one set back after another, set back after another set back.\nRene:[15:47]\nAnd with many leaders who– who went through it.\nJensen:[15:50]\nYeah, most of them are kind of like, oh, this isn’t nearly as bad as when that happened. [laughter] You know, every time something happened, it’s like, oh, it’s not. This is nothing. So the ability to to be able to go directly to remember when that happened, this is nothing. And yet this is incredibly painful. It’s it helps the company move through\nJensen:[16:10]\nthese challenging times.\nRene:[16:11]\nSo you and I have been around this industry about the same amount of time and some of the stuff that’s going on with AI, I know I feel this way, were things that I just thought I would never see. That the future generation would be able to experience the kind of transformation that seems to be taking place. It feels like to me not to sound Star Trekkie, but this\nRene:[16:31]\nis the final frontier in terms of I can’t imagine what is next beyond what we’re seeing with artificial intelligence broadly. How do you feel about it? Are we accelerating so greatly\nRene:[16:41]\nthe transformation of industry that we’ve never seen before? Is there anything next after this? It’s just unbelievable what we’re seeing.\nJensen:[16:46]\nI guess I’ve always expected that computers would demonstrate intelligent behavior. That we would be able to write software so well. And I thought we would write it, that algorithms would eventually solve problems in a way that seemingly the computer is intelligent. I never thought\nJensen:[17:07]\nthat it would result in an industrial revolution. And what I mean by that is, and you’ve heard me say this, that for the very first time, the computer industry has now transcended\nJensen:[17:17]\nbeyond the traditional computer industry, that for the very first time we’re now no longer a tool, an instrument. But we’re now a manufacturing industry. And so what I mean by that is, you know, right now, while we’re talking, our phones are in our pocket. It’s not being used. And when I’m not using it, you know, I’m not using this tool. It’s not\nJensen:[17:37]\ndoing anything for me. And most computers are that way. My laptop’s in my office, it’s doing that. Most people’s computers are that way. If you need that tool, you go use that tool. However,\nJensen:[17:47]\nthis new industry of AI factories, which is what we’re building now, they’re running all the time. Whether you’re using it or not, they’re producing tokens, they’re ingesting data, they’re producing tokens, they’re generating intelligence. Intelligence is being manufactured at a very large scale. And the idea that this computer used to be\nJensen:[18:08]\nan instrument, a tool, is now a factory, a manufacturing thing, and that is producing incredibly valuable things at very large volumes. And so this is a new time\nJensen:[18:18]\nfor our industry. This has never happened before. And the idea that computers are now the manufacturing instruments, the machinery behind this incredible thing called tokens, intelligence tokens, is just an extraordinary idea. And so we’re at the beginning of a new industrial revolution.\nRene:[18:33]\nIs it racing faster than you thought it would? And you have been closer to it than anyone with AlexNet and DGX1 and have seen the pace of innovation. From where I sit and we’ve been looking at it inside Arm quite deeply since I took over, it has gone far faster than I would have imagined two and a half years ago. Far faster than imagined, even a year ago. You’re involved in everything around it. Is it moving even\nRene:[18:53]\nfaster than you imagined?\nJensen:[18:55]\nNo, we’re trying to make it go faster. We’ve gone to a one year cycle, and the reason for that is because the technology has the opportunity to move fast. And because we are now not just building chips and we know that the rate of progress of chips anymore, if you’re lucky, with a new process node, you get a few percent.\nJensen:[19:15]\nThat’s incredible. And so how do we get X factors of performance with each generation, well the way we solve it is we designed six or seven new chips\nJensen:[19:25]\nper system and then we use co-design to reinvent the entire system and invent new things like NVLink switches and new system racks that allow us to drive copper across the entire back spine of a system to connect all of the GPUs together in very large packages and 3D packages and such. We’re using all\nJensen:[19:45]\nkinds of techniques to do that. As a result, we could deliver 2 to 3 times more performance at the same amount of energy and cost every year. And\nJensen:[19:55]\nthat’s another way of essentially reducing the cost of AI by two or three times per year. And that is way faster than Moore’s Law. And so you compound that over, right, five, six, ten years, we’re able to drive incredible cost reduction for intelligence. And the reason why we’re doing that is because we think that this is at a time\nJensen:[20:15]\nwhen we all realize the value of this. If we can drive down the cost tremendously, one, we could do things that inference time like reasoning.\nJensen:[20:25]\nYou know, today when you use ChatGPT, which is an amazing service, I use it every day. I used that this morning you hit enter and your prompt is loaded and it generates the output. But in the future it’s going to iteratively reason about the answer and come up with a tree search maybe, and maybe it does some kind of iteration and reflect on its own answers,\nJensen:[20:46]\nand eventually it produces an output. It might have gone through a hundred, a thousand inferences, but the quality of answer is so much better. We want to drive the\nJensen:[20:55]\ncost down so that we could deliver this new type of reasoning inference with the same level of cost and responsiveness as the past.\nRene:[21:03]\nI have seen a demo of the OpenAI model that does reasoning and it was shocking to your point. It went through a logic tree. You could see the tradeoffs it was making simply the way a human would, yet at a pace completely unlike the way a human would. But then as you fast forward and this is what’s so fascinating to me about this, what’s going on now, is that exactly to your point, you’re introducing systems\nRene:[21:24]\nfull data set and infrastructure at a pace the industry has never ingested at before. CPU’s bought every two or three years, they ultimately depreciated. Now you’re building systems\nRene:[21:34]\non an annual beat. People want to pay for those systems and deploy them as fast as possible.\nJensen:[21:39]\nRight now we’re talking it’s so easy to say, but, you know, we’re delivering new computers that are this room size thing each year. It’s all the cabling, all the networking, all the switching, all the software. Yeah, it’s really quite insane.\nRene:[21:52]\nDo you see it? And I’m not asking you to forward forecast. But this is more just a technology ingestion question. Can it continue at the current pace?\nJensen:[22:02]\nYeah, I think so. But it has to be done in a systematic way in the sense that everything that we do, we do in an architectural way. And what that means is that the software that you develop for yesterday’s clusters like Hoppers and that software is going to run on Blackwell and that software will run on Rubin. And the software that you create\nJensen:[22:21]\nfor Rubin is going to run on Hoppers. Well, this architectural compatibility is really quite vital because the investment of the industry on software\nJensen:[22:31]\nis a thousand times larger than the hardware. Not to mention no software ever dies. And so if you develop software, or you release software, you’ve got to maintain the software as long as you shall live. And so the architecture compatibility that the idea of CUDA is not that, you know, there are millions of people programming to it. The idea of CUDA\nJensen:[22:52]\nis that there are millions of GPUs, several hundred million GPUs that are compatible with it.\nRene:[22:58]\nSoftware doesn’t die.\nJensen:[22:59]\nYeah. And so whatever investments that you make on one GPU, you can carry forward to all the other GPUs and all the software you write today will get better tomorrow. All the software we write in the future will run in the install base. And so, number one, we have to be architectural and really disciplined about that. Second, even at the system level, we’re super\nJensen:[23:19]\narchitectural now. We’ll change pieces of the technology to advance system design without you having to leave everything that you did\nJensen:[23:29]\nyesterday behind. And so, for example, you know, when we first came into the data center business, a hyperscale data center had power distribution that was like 12 kilowatts per rack, while Blackwell’s 120 kilowatts per rack. It’s ten times, ten times the density. Now, of course, it’s ten times the density,\nJensen:[23:50]\nand it reduces millions and millions of dollars of servers and compressed it into one rack. And so the amount of savings, energy savings\nJensen:[23:59]\nand, you know, space savings, it’s just incredible.\nRene:[24:03]\nThat is very similar to our story. You know, the Arm architecture has been around for 30 years and we have software that’s been written for it for decades. And that is what people sometimes don’t always understand.\nJensen:[24:11]\nEverything we do out on every single Arm chip, we care for it. We just showed something the other day. Somebody did some benchmarking and Grace was four times the performance per energy per watt than the best CPU in world. [Rene: Bravo.] And energy efficiency is vital. That everything.\nRene:[24:29]\nDo you see anything architecturally starting to break when you go from 500-megawatt data centers to five gigawatt data centers? Just relative to the network latency, things of that nature, without getting into proprietary stuff, do you kind of a high level physics standpoint start to see some things that start to break?\nJensen:[24:48]\nEverything breaks, physics is obeyed, which is the problem, but everything breaks first. Of course, we’re moving up the power density curve very, very quickly, exponentially. And so from 12 kilowatts to 40 kilowatts, to 120, 200, and it’s going to go beyond that. And so we’re trying to compress, densify computing\nJensen:[25:08]\nas much as we can. When we do that, of course, liquid cooling becomes more efficient. When we do that, we can use copper for longer. Copper using electricity for as long as you can is good. So that you don’t have to\nJensen:[25:18]\nhop cross electrical to optical. We’ll ultimately have to go optical, but it we’ll stay with electrical as long as we can. And so as much of the data centers we have, it’s more cost effective, it’s more energy efficient, it’s more reliable. And so that causes us to densify. The other benefit of densification is that all of the GPUs that are in the particular rack\nJensen:[25:39]\nor in adjacent racks can behave as one giant GPU. It’s really quite amazing.\nRene:[25:43]\nAmazing, yeah. One of the things I’ve always been curious about Jensen, is keynotes that you did at Computex that I remember watching that when you did and it was on Sunday night, and the sheer volume of content that you go through is not only unbelievable, but as someone else who does keynotes that are not nearly as long or is in depth, I just marvel at how you pull it off. Do you\nRene:[26:03]\ndo massive amounts of rehearsal for – remember back in the day when we worked together, I remember changing them at times the evening before and you still pulled them off. But now the level\nRene:[26:13]\nof depth that you go into, particularly given that you’re talking about the datacenter architecture, you’ve expanded it out. How do you prepare for it?\nJensen:[26:21]\nWell, we’re preparing for it every day. You know, that’s kind of the nice thing about our job is we’re not actors. [laughter] And so so those are kind of our job. We kind of live in it. And so we’re number one, we’re preparing every day. But a lot of what you and I do, frankly, is teaching. In order to shape an industry, in order to shape the market and\nJensen:[26:41]\nto introduce new ideas like what we’re trying to do, a lot of it is teaching, you know, it’s not advertising, it’s not, you know. And we’re a platform company, meaning we can’t\nJensen:[26:51]\nreally do what we do without other people doing it with us. And so we’re about teaching, inspiring, showing, maybe demonstrating, and hopefully step by step by step, you know, we get more and more believers in CUDA in the beginning and NVIDIA accelerated computing today in joining us in our journey and AI and now the next big thing that we’re working on is\nJensen:[27:11]\nphysical AI and how do we teach AIs that obey the laws of physics on the one hand, and then also understand the physical laws on the other hand. So I think the journey is fairly long and so,\nJensen:[27:21]\nyou know, GTC and Computex are opportunities for us to do that, to celebrate our ecosystem and the work that they’ve done, teach them, you know, we’re sort of inspiring about the next.\nRene:[27:31]\nQuite similar, we’ll do QBUs, I’ll do presentations and my chief of staff will say, gosh, the slides are easy. That’s kind of what you say all day. And I’m thinking, well, how could it be different?\nJensen:[27:40]\nIt’s still hard, though it’s to be honest, because we don’t practice. So, you know, it’s not because we choose not to practice. By the time we get all the stuff put together, there is no time to practice. And so we just grip it and rip it.\nRene:[27:53]\nJensen, thanks much.\nJensen:[27:54]\nIt’s great to see you. Good job. Everything you’re doing. Proud of you.\nRene:[27:57]\n[chuckle] Thank you.\n[music comes in]\nRene: I’m Rene Haas, CEO of Arm and it’s been a pleasure to have you with us today.
